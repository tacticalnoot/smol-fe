# Smol Frontend - Developer Setup Guide

This guide covers setup steps for working with the **Smol-FE** codebase. All technical constraints (ports, versions) are defined in the [STATE OF WORLD](STATE_OF_WORLD.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `22.x` (See [SSOT](STATE_OF_WORLD.md))
- **pnpm**: `10.x` (See [SSOT](STATE_OF_WORLD.md))
- **mkcert**: Optional, for local HTTPS support.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kalepail/smol-fe.git
cd smol-fe

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:4321` by default.

### Authentication Strategy
Passkeys are domain-bound and require a secure context.
1. **General Dev**: Use `http://localhost:4321`. Authentication features will be limited.
2. **Full Auth Test (Recommended)**: Deploy your fork to **Cloudflare Pages**. This gives you a `*.pages.dev` domain with HTTPS, the easiest way to test Passkeys accurately.

## 🔧 Fork-Specific Configuration

### Environment Variables

This fork uses the **production API** by default. The `.env` file should contain:

```env
# Base AI Music API
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.smol.xyz

# Labs/ZK Dungeon Relay
PUBLIC_RELAYER_URL=https://api.kalefarm.xyz
```

> **Note**: The official production backend is `https://api.smol.xyz`. For Labs experiments like ZK Dungeon, we utilize the `https://api.kalefarm.xyz` relay for decentralized state syncing.

### Running the Correct Dev Server

If you have multiple `smol-fe` directories (e.g., one in `Mixtape Auto` and one cloned for development), make sure you start the dev server from the **correct directory**:

```bash
# Check which directory you're in
pwd

# Should be your fork, e.g.:
# C:\Users\YourName\path\to\tacticalnoot-smol-fe
```

The dev server output will show which port it's running on (default: 4321).

## 🎵 Mixtape Editing Feature

### Edit Mode

The mixtape editor supports both **creating** and **editing** mixtapes:

- **Create**: Click "+ Mixtape" button → Build your mixtape → Publish
- **Edit**: Navigate to your mixtape → Click "Edit Mixtape" (only visible if you're the creator) → Modify → Save Changes

### Track Reordering

Tracks can be reordered via drag-and-drop. The reordered list is sent to the API on save.

### Safe Save (API Only)

The "Save Changes" button for existing mixtapes uses a `PUT /mixtapes/:id` API call. This **does not** trigger any blockchain/wallet interactions - it only updates metadata in the database.

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "Mixtapes not loading" / Network errors

**Cause**: Wrong API URL configured  
**Fix**: Ensure `PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.smol.xyz` in your `.env` file and restart the dev server

### Login button does nothing on localhost

**Cause**: Passkeys require a secure context (HTTPS) and are domain-bound  
**Fix**: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages for full auth testing. Localhost has inherent auth limitations.

### "Edit Mixtape" button not visible

**Cause**: You're not logged in as the mixtape creator  
**Fix**: Ensure your logged-in wallet address matches the mixtape's `creator` field

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

- The backend `PUT /mixtapes/:id` endpoint includes **ownership verification** - only the original creator can edit
- Mixtape track order is stored as a comma-separated string of smol IDs in the database
- Cache is purged after updates via `purgeMixtapesCache()`
