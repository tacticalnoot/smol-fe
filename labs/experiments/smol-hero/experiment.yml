notes: |
  Advanced rhythm game experiment using real-time audio analysis.

  Technical Features:
  - Real-time onset detection using RMS energy analysis
  - Three frequency bands: Bass (20-200Hz), Mid (200-2000Hz), Treble (2000+Hz)
  - Adaptive note generation based on actual track audio
  - Timing windows: Perfect (±50ms), Great (±100ms), OK (±150ms)
  - Combo multiplier system
  - Four difficulty modes affecting lane count and note density

  Known Limitations:
  - Desktop only (requires Web Audio API)
  - iOS support limited (Web Audio disabled on mobile Safari)
  - Performance varies based on track complexity

  Future Enhancements:
  - Calibration system for latency adjustment
  - Leaderboard integration
  - Custom beatmap editor
  - Multiplayer mode
