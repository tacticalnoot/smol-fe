# Vibe Code of Ethics

## Principles
-   **Speed**: We move fast. We use AI. We accept that things will break.
-   **Autonomy**: You are smart. You have tools. You don't need permission to have a good idea.
-   **Kindness**: High velocity requires high trust. Trust requires kindness.

## Collaboration
We don't do committees. We do **syncs**.
-   **Remix Culture**: Fork it, improve it, merge it. Go for it.
-   **Default to Open**: Work in public. Share your half-baked ideas so we can bake them together.

## Anti-Patterns
-   Gatekeeping.
-   Bikeshedding (arguing over trivial details).
-   Being a buzzkill.

Let's build.

## Addendum
This code of ethics was vibe coded. If the vibe changes, we'll vibe a new vibe. Who's askin'? Fuggadabout it, I'm walkin' here!
