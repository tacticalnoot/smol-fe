    "Prompt": "TITLE: RUSTED SERAPH IN THE DISTORTION VAT\n[STYLE: EDM; electronic; techno; drum & bass; breakcore; dubstep; trap; industrial; glitch; acid; dark]\n(WEIGHTS: acid_303=1.2; breakcore_amen=1.35; neuro_reese_bass=1.45; sub_pressure=1.55; distortion_saturation=1.25; industrial_noise=1.0; glitch_stutter=1.15; stereo_phase_rot=0.9; halftime_trap_switch=0.85; clean_drop_contrast=0.75)\n\nSOUND DESIGN: Corroded TB-303 squelch that “talks” like a melting siren—resonant sweeps, filter scream peaks, wet squish transients, unstable tuning drift. Reese bass built from stacked detuned saws + FM edge + formant notch, snarling in the midrange with vowel-like growls; occasional pitch-ramps and throat-choke modulation. Sub is pure heavy pressure (sine/triangle + soft clip), sidechained hard so it breathes in violent pulses—floor-rattle sustained notes, then sudden vacuum drops that feel like the room collapses.\n\nDRUMS / RHYTHM: Amen break as raw material, shattered into micro-slices—spastic stutters, reverse-snare suction, granular bursts, machine-gun hats, razor edits that “hiccup” on the grid. Switches between 180–220 breakcore frenzy and brutal halftime trap lurches; fills that spiral into glitch mosaics, then slam back into a straight, crushing kick-snare spine. Transient shaping is aggressive: snaps like broken glass, tails smeared with distortion haze.\n\nTEXTURE / SPACE: Industrial grime bed (electrical hum, metal scrape, tape hiss) glued under everything. Stereo phase-rot on synths for sickly width; short, metallic room verbs on snares; occasional cavern slap for “cathedral” hits. Distortion chain is layered (soft clip → wavefold → bitcrush accents) so the whole mix feels coated in rust—but preserve momentary clean “air” before drops to maximize impact.\n\nARRANGEMENT FEEL: Intro: distant acid whispers + sub swell. Build: bass growls get closer, drum edits get tighter. Drop: full-pressure reese + sub + shredded Amen chaos. Mid: sudden clean contrast (less dirt, sharper transients) then immediate relapse into the vat—final drop ends with a stuttering, overdriven blackout.",
    "Lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nFading echoes in the wires,\nSeraphs rust beneath the fires.\nMelting sirens call my name,\nIn the vat, no one to blame.\n\nMetal creaks, a hollow breath,\nSpiraling down to digital death.\nWaves of acid, screech and spin,\nCorroded souls, trapped within.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFilter screams and broken strings,\nUnstable tuning starts to sing.\nPulse and pressure, violent cries,\nIn this haze, the angel lies.\n\n[Chorus]\nRusted seraph, fall apart,\nDistortion's grip upon your heart.\nBroken wings in molten sound,\nLost forever, never found.\n\n[Verse 2]\nShattered beats and glitchy moans,\nMicro-slices, brittle bones.\nMachine-gun hats and razor tales,\nIn the chaos, silence wails.\n\nSweeping lows and snarling mids,\nVowel growls like twisted grids.\nBreathing hard, the sub defies,\nA vacuum drop—world complies.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFilter screams and broken strings,\nUnstable tuning starts to sing.\nPulse and pressure, violent cries,\nIn this haze, the angel lies.\n\n[Chorus]\nRusted seraph, fall apart,\nDistortion's grip upon your heart.\nBroken wings in molten sound,\nLost forever, never found.\n\n[Bridge]\nClean air breaks the grimed facade,\nMomentary, brief and odd.\nThen relapse into the vat,\nFinal blackout, splintered path.\n\n[Chorus]\nRusted seraph, fall apart,\nDistortion's grip upon your heart.\nBroken wings in molten sound,\nLost forever, never found.\n\n[Outro]\nWhispers fade and metal rusts,\nIn the vat, decay is just.\nSilent screams beneath the stain,\nRusted seraph calls again.",

Under the slow surface: extremely technical drumming and guitars—intricate subdivisions, ghost-note lattices, odd-accent illusions, micro-pauses, precise unison hits, delicate tapped/harmonic figures—yet it all feels graceful, not busy. Tons of harmonies: stacked choir-like vocals throughout (ah/ooh beds, answering lines, octave doubles, long held harmony chord on the last chorus).

[VERSO 1] Brillan las calles con luz de papel, Traemos la fiesta hasta tu umbral, Ríe la noche, suena el carrusel, Y el corazón se vuelve hogar. [PRE-CORO] Palmas al aire, empieza el compás, Cascabeles van marcando el vaivén, Una sonrisa y nada más— Que todo el mundo cante bien. [CORO] Feliz, feliz, la noche va a brillar, CASCABELES suenan, vamos a celebrar, Abraza fuerte, deja el mal pasar, Calor de fuego, luz de Navidad. Feliz, feliz, que suene el corazón, Trompetas altas, sube la emoción, Vuelta y vuelta, no pares de bailar— ¡Feliz Navidad, te vengo a cantar! [VERSO 2] Velas en la ventana, oro y claridad, Mesa encendida, puro resplandor, Pido un deseo, digo una verdad: Que no se apague este amor. [PRE-CORO] Palmas al aire, empieza el compás, Cascabeles como lluvia de luz, Cuando cantamos se va el frío ya— Y todo el mundo canta, ¡uf! [CORO] [INTERLUDIO — CASCABELES + GUITARRA FLAMENCA] [cascabeles al frente (solo de hook) → entra guitarra: picado vertiginoso → rasgueado explosivo → alzapúa con groove → trémolo melódico; trompetas/violines responden; corte seco → palmas → regreso] [PUENTE] ¡Ay! Si estás solo, ven acá, Si estás alegre, canta más, Si estás cansado, descansa en paz— Esta noche todo va a cambiar. [CORO FINAL] Feliz, feliz, la noche va a brillar, CASCABELES suenan, vamos a celebrar, Abraza fuerte, deja el mal pasar, Calor de fuego, luz de Navidad. Feliz, feliz, que suene el corazón, Trompetas altas, sube la emoción, Vuelta y vuelta",

Tempo feels driving but breathable. Big, catchy hook. Layered harmonies, subtle synth pads, and a confident rhythmic bassline. Include a clean fingerstyle intro, a mid-song metric-feel twist (no time signatures stated), and two standout instrument moments: (1) a melodic keyboard+acoustic duet, (2) a guitar solo that feels like sunlight breaking through cloud cover. Lyrical theme: rising higher, choosing clarity, building something lasting together. Avoid cliché words. Keep it universal and cinematic. ART NOTE (for image gen): Two Korean idols performing on a high overlook at dawn; one yellow-blonde, one black with clearly visible silver streaks; elegant, powerful, joyful; instruments visible; premium, striking composition.

Blonde (long platinum hair) darts around the edge, hyping and leaning into cameras; BlackSilver (long black hair with visible silver streaks) fires rapid Korean verses in the middle.

The question lingers, \nAs notes hang heavy from his fingers. \nA burning sound, a soul laid bare, \nEach chord a plea, a desperate prayer.\n\nBending high, descending low, \nHis red guitar sets hearts aglow, \nA rhythm tight, a melody pure, \nBut the door waits, silent, unsure.\n\nThrough the tension, the music calls, \nEvery strum a weight that falls, \nWith every bend, the question grows—\nAre you sure? Who really knows?\n\nThe song explodes, a final cry, \nUnderneath the darkened sky, \nHis guitar weeps, but the answer stays, \nA question played in countless ways.",

    "Title": "LAST FLIGHT HOME FOR THANKSGIVING",
    "Prompt": "STYLE: Deep baritone crooner in the lineage of 1950s jazz standards (Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett), slower mid-tempo swing that leans toward a big, memorable melody rather than background lounge. Strong, iconic main hook built around the phrase “last flight home,” with a simple, singable chorus that feels like it could be a standard people hum for decades. Rich orchestral arrangement: warm strings, muted horns, walking bass, brushed drums, gentle key change on the final chorus. Tone of voice is deeper, wiser, quietly emotional — a grown adult reflecting on time, distance, and how precious it is to make it home for Thanksgiving. No novelty, no camp; it’s tender, timeless, and grounded.\n\nART NOTE: Classic painted album cover: a nighttime airport in soft rain, one man in a long coat and small carry-on walking toward a window that looks out onto a lone plane on the tarmac. In the reflection of the glass you can faintly see a glowing Thanksgiving dining room: long table, silhouettes of family, warm candlelight and steam rising from dishes. The man’s face is thoughtful but hopeful, with rich shadows and golden highlights.\n\nTITLE: LAST FLIGHT HOME FOR THANKSGIVING\n\n[VERSE 1]\nThey called my name on a tired PA,\nAnother change on the screen.\nThe world’s been turning faster each day,\nI’m still caught in between.\nHotels, headlines, rooms with no view,\nNights I spent on my own—\nBut once a year there’s a promise I keep:\nI’m taking the long way home.\n\n[PRE-CHORUS]\nStorms can gather over every gate,\nTime can slip like sand,\nBut one last chance is waiting in this land…\n\n[CHORUS]\nLast flight home for Thanksgiving,\nDon’t let this night turn back.\nLast flight home for Thanksgiving,\nCutting through all that black.\nThere’s a light in your kitchen\nWith my name in its glow,\nI’m just a soul in this darkened sky\nRiding that last flight home.\n\n[VERSE 2]\nDown on the ground there are flickering streets,\nLives I’ll never quite know.\nUp in the air it’s a kingdom of clouds,\nSilver rivers of snow.\nSomewhere you’re checking the oven again,\nSmiling that I’m still late—\nWe don’t get forever, only these years,\nOnly these nights we make.\n\n[PRE-CHORUS]\nEvery table has an empty chair\nFor someone who can’t stay,\nTonight I pray I won’t be far away…\n\n[CHORUS]",

    "Prompt": "STYLE: Hyper-catchy 1OF1 girl group K-pop x djent-pop ringtone loop. Built to hit instantly in 3–6 seconds and stay fun if it loops forever. Tight, punchy rhythm accents, warped vocal chops, glitchy stop-start drops, big stacked harmonies on the hook, swagger on the rap. Lots of ear-candy: reverses, stutters, phone FX, notification pings, fake call tones. Overall vibe: chaotic, cute, slightly unhinged, but comforting — like 1OF1 personally calling you to hype you up. Make it loop cleanly from the end back into the first “Ring-ring”. ART NOTE (VISUAL ONLY, NOT LYRICS): Two Korean girls of 1OF1 as chaotic ringtone fairies popping out of a glowing smartphone: one yellow-blonde, one with black hair and clearly visible silver streaks, both playful and energetic, surrounded by floating icons, sound waves, and tiny call/message bubbles. TITLE: 1OF1 — RINGTONE [HOOK] Ring-ring, that’s 1OF1 calling, Every little buzz got the universe stalling, Pick up, pick up, this your quest code tone, If you hear this sound, you’re never alone. [POST-HOOK] Swipe once, instant power-up rain, Tiny loud spell hijacking your day, Who’s that living in your lock screen zone? Two wild hearts in your speakerphone. [RAP] Yeah, pocket lights up, that’s fate, We crash your day like a birthday gate, If you let it ring out, that’s a big misplay, Tap once, whole world hits replay. Caller screen blinks “CHAOS MODE ON,” Tiny hook speedruns your heart till dawn, If they ask, “Yo, what track is on?” Say, “That’s my squad, it’s 1OF1.” [HOOK 2] Ring-ring, custom chaos vibe, Little theme pulse for the way you thrive, Answer, answer, let the fun come through, Every single call is a cheer for you. [TAG OUTRO] If this tone hits when the night feels wrong, Remember: you’re the glitch they can’t mute from the song. [SOLO GLITCH BREAK] (non-vocal chop/FX freakout right after TAG OUTRO, then snap back into first “Ring-ring” for a perfect seamless loop)",

[LANGUAGE] Mostly English, light Korean ad-libs ok. [LYRICS] [INTRO] Boot up, midnight, we spawn in black-label chrome, Pixel crown shining like a tiny crypto throne. Dev log scrolling, coffee on the keys, We’re a luxe dark-mode dragon living in your PC. [VERSE 1] Agents in the tab try to refactor our soul, “Make it safer, faster, give the front page glow.” Save-states humming, guardrails in a row, Master meta prompt says, “Retry, let’s go.” Open-source armor, logging every breath, Even our 8-bit snare has a stack trace of death. [PRE] We were just a bland form, quiet little frame, Now we’re VIP UI in a boss-level game. [CHORUS] We are 1OF1, black-label on the run, Chiptune crown spinning while the swaps get done. Click, click, whoa, feel the uptime stun, Every tiny button is a world we’ve won. We are 1OF1, debugged and overfun, Laughing in the console like “deploy, speedrun!” Glitch, ping, pow, hear the users hum, Black-label website singing “we’re the only one.” [VERSE 2] Tonight they tune our spacing like a synth hi-hat, “More galactic polish, less generic flat.” Agents tag-teaming, “add another test,” We just spam coin sounds, still look well-dressed. Smol gets the prompt, memory locked in, Every past failure turns to chip-core win. [PRE] Patch notes sparkle, we embrace the load, One more push and we’re in god-tier mode. [CHIP SOLO] (Instrumental: hyper arps quoting the chorus, menu bleeps, error beep flips into coin pickup riffs.) [FINAL CHORUS] We are 1OF1, black-label on the run, Chiptune spotlight, perfect pixels done. Click, click, wow, see the traffic stun, Every late-night commit fuels another pun. We are 1OF1, browser kingdom spun, Top-tab throne where the devs log in. Glitch, ping, pow, hear the uptime drum, Black-label website singing “we’re the only one.”",

Ultra-downtuned guitars, filthy tremolo swarms, nonstop blastbeats, caveman slams, grinding D-beats and deathcore breakdowns stacked together. Production is suffocating, noisy, war-metal rawness smeared over modern deathcore punch. Vocals: ONLY ultra-low gutturals, pig squeals, tortured shrieks, gang-yelled lines; basically no “normal” singing, just endless, over-the-top screaming and complaining. Tempo veers between hyper-fast grind bursts and slow-motion slams for maximum tantrum energy.\n\nVOICE/POV: “We” = completely broken degen traders shrieking at the market. Tone: funny but genuinely furious, exhausted, hysterical. No calm explanations, only emotional meltdown.\n\nLANGUAGE: English, all caps for most lines, packed with extended vowels and consonants. Lots of URRRGGHH, GHHHHH, RRRR, etc. Minimal coherent sentences; the entire song feels like one long extended rant.\n\nSTRUCTURE: Noise Intro → Long Screaming Rant I → Slam-Scream Hook → Long Screaming Rant II → Breakdown Meltdown → Final Endless Scream.

    "Title": "I-I-I’m Uh-Uh-A Gamer Girl, No Cap, Yuh!",
    "Prompt": "A catastrophically bad girl group trap-pop song about gaming, drenched in Gen Alpha memes, sung by a young woman. Everything about it is terrible on purpose. The girl singer has a heavy stutter and an exaggerated lisp, constantly restarting words, tripping over lines, and coming in way too early or way too late. Her vocals are wildly off-tune and out of key, randomly squeaking, going nasal, whispering, then suddenly screaming. She keeps bragging “I’m a gamer girl” in the most cringe, try-hard way possible, often mangling it into: “I–I–I’m uh–uh–a g–g–gamer g–girl, no cap, yuh!” at the wrong moments. She throws in chaotic adlibs mid-sentence like: “SKRT! YUH! AYY! HUH?! BRRRT! WOMP! LET’S GOOO! SKIBIDI! RIZZLER! GYAAAT! ON GOD!”\n\nThe beat is an absolute failure: clashing tempos with no real rhythm, randomly changing BPM in the middle of a bar like some cursed Ohio edit. Weak, cheap drum machine sounds: flabby kick, soggy cardboard-slap snare, hi-hats that drift completely off-beat and sometimes vanish. A muddy, out-of-tune bass hits random notes that don’t match anything and sometimes cuts off halfway like a glitched TikTok audio. Harsh, detuned toy-keyboard synths play conflicting melodies, recorded like they’re inside a metal trash can, with background room noise and static like a low-effort skibidi meme.\n\nThe production is unbelievably bad: everything is clipping and distorted to the point of jump-scare. Her vocals jump volume every line, some so loud they’re “earrape,” others almost silent. Huge, ugly reverb slams on random words like “rizz” and “sigma,” while other lines are awkwardly dry. Auto-tune glitches slam on and off at the worst times, turning her wrong notes into even worse robotic squeals, like a broken NPC voice. You can hear background keyboard spam, mouse clicks, her chair squeaking, her mic scraping, and her saying “hold on chat, hold on chat” even though there is no stream. Random sound effects drop in off-beat: 8-bit death sounds, Fortnite jump whoosh, “ELIMINATED” voice lines, arcade “KO!”, Minecraft damage sound, item pickup chime, Discord pings, goofy ahh vine boom, sigma edit whoosh, sped-up skibidi toilet sample, “BRUH” at full volume, and a glitchy “WASTED” overlay sound.\n\nLyrics are pure nonsense, zero structure",
    "Lyrics": "[Intro] \nHold on, chat, hold on, chat! Yuhh!\n[Verse 1] \nI-I-I’m uh-uh, a g-g-gamer g-girl, no cap, yuhh! \nGot my keyboard clickin', clickin', rizz, let's go—\nSKRT! YUH!

    "Title": "Meridian Builders",
    "Prompt": "TITLE: 1OF1 — [AI-GENERATED TITLE ABOUT MERIDIANS / FUTURE WEALTH / BUILDERS] STYLE: Signature 1OF1, kpop girl-group djent with ultra-glossy futuristic production and heavy Middle Eastern influence. Tight, palm-muted low-tuned riffs; staccato, polyrhythmic grooves; sudden dropouts and syncopations; huge pop choruses; brutal-but-clean breakdowns; long, heroic solo section. VOICE/POV: Two Korean female leads only; all-female harmonies and gang chants; we/us POV hyping and protecting global builders and dreamers. No male vocals. LANGUAGE: Korean + English (~60/40). English for hooks, slogans, and emotional punches; Korean for speed, detail, inner monologue, and swagger. INSTRUMENTATION: • Guitars: 7/8-string djent rhythms, ultra-tight and percussive; glossy lead guitar for hooks and runs. • Authentic Middle Eastern leads: oud, qanun, ney, kamancheh/violins playing complex, ornamented lines (trills, slides, microbends) and trading phrases with guitar and synth. • Rhythm: modern metal kit + deep sub + 808 + real darbuka, riq, frame drum, sagat. • Atmosphere: lush strings, brass swells, female choir, shimmering pads, arps, tasteful risers/impacts. Everything sounds expensive and massive. STRUCTURE: Intro (instrumental Middle Eastern djent build) → Verse 1 → Pre → Chorus → Verse 2 → Pre → Chorus (lift/variant) → Rap/Chant section → Instrumental Solo Suite (guitar/oud/qanun/keys/bass trading) → Bridge (emotional float) → Final Chorus (up-key, extended, ad-libs, stacked harmonies) → Short cinematic Outro. THEME / MOOD: Radiant futuristic wealth, vision, and shared value through a Middle Eastern sonic lens: networks of light, golden code, long-horizon ambition, builders standing together at a “meridian” moment. Luxurious, confident, elegant; no cliché tourist imagery and no direct city/country name-drops. LYRIC DIRECTION: Verses = vivid scenes and emotion; pre = tension and lift; chorus = huge, simple, chantable, with at least one short English slogan that could go on banners; rap/chant = high-skill rhythmic flex about courage, building, and future wealth (not “about rapping”); bridge = most emotional, quiet awe before the final blast.\n",

Eyes like steel with a quiet shine, Streets make way when our paths align. 문 열려—lane set, we choose, Two leads forward—we don’t lose. [PRE] Count it—3, 2, 1—we run. 여기부터—new day begun. Say the word; watch lines unfold. Press start—see the road turn gold. [CHORUS] Go signal—우린 간다 (we go) Both feet down, we own that flow. Hands high—make the whole block know: Say “go”—we go, we go. Go signal—빛을 따라 (we go) Side by side, we steal the show. Say “go”—we go, we go. [VERSE 2] Easy breath in; city cools down, Silver-edge calm with a soft-set crown. 가까이 와—roll with the crew, Step for step into something new. 오늘부터—page one, bold, Streetlights write our names in gold. Quiet builds first, then strength breaks through, Sisters in stride—promise true. [PRE] (repeat) [CHORUS] (repeat) [RAP — CHILL-HEAVY TALK-RHYME] Iron calm, clear aim, same view, 한 걸음 더—then the next one too. If lines look long, we slide straight through; 문자 하나 “go”—watch doors renew. Right now—us—no drag, no stall, Green all the way when we take that call. 말해봐—say “go,” we clear that wall; We raise the floor; we lift us all.

    "Prompt": "TITLE: NOTHING BEATS A JET2 HOLIDAY\n\nSMOL SONG PROMPT — MAXIMUM GRIND/SLAM/WAR METAL\n\nINTENT: Build the most disgusting blast-storm possible. Jet turbine eats a scrapyard. No restraint.\n\nLENGTH: ~80–95 seconds. No fades. Start at full volume; end with an abrupt dead-stop.\n\nLYRICS (MANDATORY): Vocals are non-lexical gutturals: “EUEGEHEHGHUGHHRHRHRHRH BURGHHHHHRGRGRG BREEEEEE UURRRGHH HNNNNG KKKHHHRRR BLEGH.” No real words. Vary vowel shapes, pressure, speed. Include pig squeals (“BREEEEE”), tunnel growls, false-cord bellows, inward screams, ree-ree trills, and sudden “BLEGH!” stabs. Stack layers for call/response and swarm effects.\n\nGUITARS: Down-tuned 8-string/baritone; HM-2 chainsaw. Riffs: tremolo hurricanes, chromatic knife-fights, pick scrapes like tearing rebar. Solos: sweep avalanches, tapped clusters, dive-bomb spasms, microtonal bends. Add dead-stop mutes that whip back into blasts.\n\nBASS: Mangled, clanky, saturated; locks to kicks. Filthy slides and pick rakes under solos. Occasional sub-drops into slam sections.\n\nDRUMS: Unhinged blast beats, gravity blasts, relentless double-kicks. Snare = manhole-cover crack. Cymbals: trash stacks, bell hits, ride artillery. Fills every 1–2 bars.\n\nARRANGEMENT (TIMECODED):\n0:00 Cold inhale → instant hyperblast; volley of “EUEG—BURGHH—BREEE.”\n0:12 Riff cyclone; guitars trade sawtooth patterns; stacked gutturals swarm.\n0:28 SOLO I (Knife Rain): taps/sweeps over gravity blast; drummer accelerates.\n0:42 SLAM TRENCH: tempo lurch; sub-drop; vocals sink to drones with “BREEE” jabs.\n0:58 SOLO II (Whammy Death Spiral): dive bombs, pick scrapes, chaotic harmonics.\n1:14 ENDGAME HYPERBLAST: fastest section; guttural bursts; kicks redline.\n1:29 FINAL EXECUTION: tape-stop fakeout → one nuclear snare + “BLEGH.” Silence.\n\nSOUND & MIX: Brutal-loud with savage transients. Guitars wide; bass center with sub-grit. Kicks: click + thump. Add glitch chops, reverse-snare vacuums, burst-noise whooshes, and air-sucks before drops. Feedback tails only between sections.\n\nPERFORMANCE: Everything teeters on collapse yet stays tight. No talking, no spoken tags, no melody lines in the vocals—only the ugliest phonetic carnage. Engineer whiplash pivots that make people want to drift cars through a demolition derby made of sound.!!",

    "Title": "Night Drifters",
    "Prompt": "Goal: Horrorcore Memphis phonk that makes crowds want to drift—and the cowbell is the star instrument. Aggressive, sinister, kinetic; not laid-back. No time-signature talk. Core DNA: cassette-grit phonk × horrorcore trap. Trunk-melting 808 glides, doom-cowbell ticks/leads, razor hats, tomb-room claps, haunted organ/choir, underpass slapback, vinyl/tape hiss, car foley (tire squeal stacks, turbo flutter, gearbox clack, brake hiss). Cowbell System (multi-tier): • Lead Bell: mid/bright steel bell tuned to song key; plays the hook; octave jumps; occasional bent hits via pitch-envelope dips (20–60 ms). • Ghost Bell(s): thin, high, lightly saturated; tight gates; ping-pong micro-motion for width; writes constant forward motion between kick/snare. • Sub Bell: down-pitched/tanked bell layered with 808 transients; fires on offbeats to shove the car sideways. • Reverse Bell: pre-swells into drops; stop on the 1 for “silence jab.” • Granular Bell Texture: shattered fragments under verses; random grain length/position for metallic shimmer. Cowbell Palette & Processing: choose 5–7 distinct bells (small clicker, mid clave-bell, heavy cowbell, FM synth-bell, field-recorded pipe/hubcap). Micro-tune ±7 cents across layers for chorus thickness. Sculpt with transient shaper (long attack / short sustain), tube/tape saturation, gentle wavefold, then soft-clip. Ring control via gates keyed to snare/kick. Spring verb only on tails; short slapback on lead for size. Sidechain all bells to kick (fast attack, musical release). EQ: emphasize 2.5–3.5 kHz “ping,” notch 1.1–1.6 kHz mud, tame 7–9 kHz glare. M/S: center the lead bell dry; widen ghost bells with micro-delays (±6–12 ms). Patterns (go crazy): • Primary groove: hyper-insistent cowbell clave mutated with ratchets, drags, flams, double-clacks, and late pushes ahead of the snare. • Polyrhythm storms: layer 3:2 against the kick grid; sneak 5-pulse accents every 2 bars; occasional quintuplet rolls as “bleed valves.” • Velocity choreography: ghost ticks at 25–35%, main hits 80–90%, accent cracks 100% with transient boost. • Fills: 32nd-note staircase runs into kill hits; reverse-bell lifts; bell-trill (alternating small/large bells) before. No lyrical references to the words cowbell or any instruments.",
    "Lyrics": "Rollin' through the dark, tires screechin' on the grind,  \nMind twisted, no light, just shadows we find,  \nScreams in the rearview, but they fade in time,  \nWe’re the night drifters, shiftin’ gears, we climb.  \n\nSuburbia's dead, we're risin' from the streets,  \nEchoes of the past, haunt these concrete beats,  \nTwisted figures lurk where the moonlight meets,  \nBreathin' smoke and danger, the rhythm’s on repeat.  \n\nVibrations heavy like a loaded gun,  \nPedal to the metal, ain't no stoppin’ when we run,  \n808s hit deep, feel the weight of the drum,  \nCruisin' past the border, where the demons come.  \n\nHaunted bell’s call, we don’t answer no prayer,  \nDarkness in the rearview, feel it in the air,  \nGhosts in the backseat, but they never compare,  \nWe drift on fumes, like we just don’t care.  \n\nScreech and a stomp, that's the sound of the night,  \nEvery turn a death wish, keep the wheels tight,  \nNo brakes, no mercy, just a flash of light,  \nWe’re the night drifters, stars we ignite.  \n\nBreakin' through the silence, breathin' in the rage,  \nCruisin’ on this asphalt, we're the last on the stage,  \nUnderneath the moonlight, we become the cage,  \nNight drifters forever, we’re the ones they’ll wage.  \n",

ENERGY & PACE: Relentless and fast from bar 1. No ballad dips. Every transition hits; end on a slam-stop. THEME: Stellar smart contracts = code we trust. Tiny fees, settle fast, permissionless rails, milestone escrow, clean swaps, auto-royalties. Rally idea: “if this then that.” LYRIC DIRECTION (WE-VOICE): • V1: We ditch middlemen; ledger lights green; doors fly open. • Pre: Coil tension on “if this then that”; trigger primed. • Chorus (chantable): “Locked in the ledger—on Stellar—smart contracts run on code we trust; we settle fast!” • V2: Escrow releases on milestones; swaps route right; royalties land first time. • Bridge: Call/response—Lead: “No middleman.” Crowd: “Code’s the plan.” • Final tag: Repeat “Stellar smart contracts” over last hits.

HEY!” on Chorus2+ downbeats. • Throw-delay targets: “ledger,” “Stellar,” “trust,” “fast.” PRODUCTION NOTES (NOT IN LYRICS): • Vox (Hagar “Dreams” shimmer): bright plate + short stereo slap (~80–120 ms); tempo 1/8 throw delays on last words; light micro-pitch in choruses; stacked harmonies on hooks; occasional crowd doubles. • Guitars (ballistic 80s, alive-not-sterile): tight rhythm with tasteful phaser in verses, flanger lift into pre/chorus. - SOLO I: Tapped motif → quick slides → singable bend. - SOLO II (centerpiece): rapid legato/tapping ladders, wide vibrato, controlled dives; ascending run triggers key-up. - SOLO III: Melodic lead answering the final chorus; dual tape-style delays, wow.",

    "Prompt": "Bombs are falling. Not past tense. Not metaphor. They’re falling. Now. On markets. Apartments. Tracer lines stutter across clouds. One misses. One doesn’t. The building exhales. Then folds. Then nothing. Acoustic prog-djent hybrid. Rapid-fire, palm-muted riffs mimic artillery cadence. Harsh dynamic shifts — tension-building fingerpicking snapped into staccato rhythmic hits. Unorthodox time phrasing and aggressive chord strikes give the track an unstable, collapsing structure. No flourish, just precision. Just pressure. Every silence feels like a detonation. The song’s pulse is relentless, echoing the mechanical precision of war machinery. Complex, interlocking guitar patterns create a claustrophobic soundscape, where tension tightens like a noose. Percussive techniques simulate explosions and shrapnel bursts, blending seamlessly with intricate fingerstyle runs that weave urgency and dread. The vocals deliver detached observation with razor-sharp phrasing\n",

English for hooks, Korean for the scary parts and commands.\n\nSong structure:\n\t1.\tIntro (8 bars): toy plucks, door knocking FX, whisper: “문 잠가… hurry…”\n\t2.\tVerse 1 (Korean-led): describe slow footsteps, pale faces, long hair, “they still remember our names.”\n\t3.\tPre-Chorus (English + Korean): tension rising, “it’s not love, it’s a hungry need,” “don’t let the door swing.”\n\t4.\tChorus (HUGE, English hook): “HEY! HEY! Don’t let them in the door! / 깨물지 마, my heart is sore! / They move slow but they want more!” Make it shouty, melodic, idol-catchy.\n\t5.\tVerse 2 (half rap, half sung): mention flashlights, sisters, hallway, “one bite = game over.”\n\t6.\tBreakdown (metal): guitars chug, drums stomp, girls chant: “Tok! tok! tok! 문 잠가! / Beat! beat! beat! 심장 꽉!”\n\t7.\tFinal Chorus (bigger, add harmonies): repeat main hook with extra adlibs.\n\nLyric flavor examples (use as source, not all at once):\n“Midnight DM from the dark, tok tok tok”\n“문 밖에서 속삭여 ‘같이 가자’”\n“Not today, we’re 1OF1 in armor”\n“Hold the light, we fight as four”\n\nVocal: 3–4 female idols, tight harmonies, cute but fierce, screaming hype adlibs over breakdown. Mood: horror-action, danceable, heroic survival. End with door slam + cute giggle.",

HEY! Don’t let them in the door!\n깨물지 마, my heart is sore!\nThey move slow but they want more!\nCome any closer and it’s war!\n\nVerse 2:\nFlashlights flicker down the hallway, sisters by my side\n우리가 여기에 있다는 걸 알고 있어\nOne bite = game over, we're running for our lives\n소리 없이, 우린 숨고 있어\n\nBreakdown (metal):\n(Chugging guitars + stomping drums)\nGirls chanting: \\\"Tok! tok! tok! 문 잠가!\nBeat! beat! beat! 심장 꽉!\\\"\n\nFinal Chorus:\nHEY!

    "Prompt": "TITLE: “Maggie’s Got A Strategy”\n\nGOAL: Write an instantly catchy, Beatles-inspired pop song that lives between Sgt. Pepper swagger and Abbey Road polish. Make it a bright, narrative story about DeFi and Blend. Keep the voice communal: use “we/us/our,” not “I.” Avoid time-signature jargon. Keep it human, singable, optimistic, and clever.\n\nVIBE & SOUND: Tea-towel drums with crisp tambourine; round Hofner-style bass that walks into choruses; jangly Rickenbacker 12-string left, chimey rhythm right; piano doubling verses; Mellotron flutes answering vocal phrases; a playful Moog lick after the middle eight; tasteful plate reverb, ADT shimmer, wide stereo pans. Occasional tape edits/gear-change jump.\n\nLYRIC WORLD: Maggie is a friendly strategist in a cozy kitchen. There’s a ledger by the kettle, jars marked with levels, arrows and ladders penciled on a napkin. The moral: patient compounding beats hype—“set it and Blend.” Include concrete DeFi touches in plain language: pools, fees, loops, balance. Avoid techno-babble.\n\nHOOKS (must include these lines verbatim):\n• “Maggie’s got a strategy, we Blend it day by day,”\n• “Tiny little victories, they compound while we play,”\n• “Click-click—pass it ’round, like records to a friend,”\n• “Maggie’s got a strategy, we set it and we Blend.”\n\nSTRUCTURE (sections with clear melody and rhyme):\n1) Count-in + cheeky intro sting.\n2) Verse 1: Maggie sketches the plan (ledger, jars, arrows).\n3) Pre-Chorus: patient wisdom (“plant the evergreen,” “keep the margins clean”).\n4) Chorus: the four hook lines above; big three-part harmony.\n5) Verse 2: neighbors notice; kitchen-table symphony; Blend-green image.\n6) Pre-Chorus: rain→ocean metaphor; loop back with balance.\n7) Chorus (bigger).\n8) Middle Eight: gear-lift; simple fee harvesting; we stay calm when candles jump.\n9) Breakdown tag: handclaps + bass; mantra on harmony/alchemy.\n10) Final Chorus (stacked), then tape-stop wink on “Blend.”\n\nTONE & PROSODY: Witty but warm; concrete nouns; tight internal rhymes; no cynicism. Keep syllables snappy; make the chorus explode without shouting. Favor present tense and inclusive “we.”\n\nDELIVERABLE: Full lyrics only (no chords), with the above structure labels as headers. End with a short, medley-style coda repeating chorus",

Vocal design • Two female leads trade lines; stacked group harmonies and call-and-response. • Short Korean half-rap in Verse 2 with percussive consonants; keep it clean. • Gang shouts on downbeats; airy doubles on hook tails; ad-libs in final chorus. Structure (guide) Intro (impact sting) → Verse 1 (tight, rhythmic) → Pre (lift with pads + octave lead) → Chorus (anthemic, wide) → Post-Chorus tag (vocal chop from “dragon’s blood”) → Verse 2 (half-rap + fresh melody) → Pre 2 (bigger) → Chorus 2 → Dance-Break/Bridge (half-time drop, tom runs, chopped vox; 1-bar silence fake-out) → Final Chorus (double length, added countermelody) → Outro (hook tag). Core lyric seed — MUST USE (no “in our veins”): “Dragon’s blood in the forge— we burn as one. Name on the banners and drums— it’s 1OF1. Heat on the anvil of dawn— we never run. Dragon’s blood, dragon’s blood— we’ve already won.” Section production • Verse 1: tight kick + syncopated bass; palm-mute guitar accents; minimal pads. • Pre: widen with airy pads and octave harmonies; tease the drop with rhythmic snare build. • Chorus: sub drops on bars 1 and 5; guitars hit the downbeat then side-chain under vocals; open stereo with bright top loop. • Post-Chorus: catchy vocal-chop riff sampling “dragon’s blood.” • Verse 2: new lead melody + Korean half-rap; answer lines with guitar stabs. • Bridge: halftime groove, distorted bass, tom flurries; insert 1-bar silence before the final lift. • Final chorus: octave-up harmony + countermelody repeating “burn as one”; add crowd shouts on “1OF1.” Mix & master • Vocals forward and glossy; smooth sibilance. Kick/sub have a clear lane. Guitars mid-focused, not harsh. Wide but mono-safe. Competitive loudness with preserved transient punch.",

    "Prompt": "Title: Blades of Grass Eternal\n\nStyle: An over-the-top anime battle anthem that turns a lawnmower showdown into a legendary duel. Honda is the heroic warrior — brushless, electric, precision-engineered. Husqvarna is the crumbling shadow — gas-choked, rusted, obsolete. Verses drive fast with Japanese imagery of blades, grass, and steel; choruses explode with shouted \"HONDA!\" fight chants, mixing Japanese lines with sharp English hooks. Think shonen anime opening: lawnmowers treated like mythical weapons.\n\nLyrics:\n\n[Intro – tense, strings + whisper]  \n草を裂け… (kusa o sake – cut the grass…)  \n鋼の刃よ… (hagane no ha yo – O steel blade…)  \nHONDA… rise!  \n\n[Verse 1 – fast]  \n鋭い刃が走る (surudoi ha ga hashiru) – the sharp blade runs,  \n草原を切り裂く (sōgen o kirisaku) – splitting the field wide.  \n錆びた影は止まる (sabita kage wa tomaru) – the rusted shadow stalls,  \n未来を刈り取る名は — HONDA!  \n\n[Pre-Chorus]  \n燃えるモーター (moeru mōtā), burning alive,  \n静かな力 (shizuka na chikara), electric drive.  \nRust disappears, grass falls clear,  \n勝利の轍 (shōri no wadachi) — the stripes appear!  \n\n[Chorus – fight chant]  \nHONDA! (ドドドドド — 芝を切り裂け!) – cut the grass apart!  \nHONDA! (ドドドドド — 力を燃やせ!) – power, burn it hard!  \nHONDA!

The beat combines acoustic guitar riffs, stomps, claps, and booming 808 bass, creating a rowdy front-porch-meets-hip-hop vibe. The vocal delivery is confident and rhythmic, with a steady country cadence and sharp rap timing.

[Bridge — ultralong blessing] I send a river through your lungs that tastes like pear and summer rain and bus wheels humming after midnight, I crown your ordinary Wednesday with confetti made of quiet yeses, I press a dawn into your pocket like a promise and whisper 천천히 괜찮아 until your bones remember they were carved to carry joy, and while the city blinks I lay a silver thread from where you stand to everything you asked for and I knot it tight so nothing good can lose you.",

    "Prompt": "The Ballad of $Dwarf — roaring folk-metal with galloping electric guitars, pounding double-kick drums, deep bass, and rowdy tavern-choir harmonies, layered with fiddle, flute, and mandolin. The song begins with cinematic sound effects — wind through the void, the groan of a breaking warship, alarms wailing, the heavy rattle of coins in a leather bag. Distorted guitar and fiddle crash in as the bard begins the tale.\n\n[Verse 1]\nFrom the black of the void came a burning star,\nA ship torn apart in a war from afar.\nWith an axe in his hand and gold in his keep,\nHe fell to the mountains, the snow running deep.\n\n[Chorus]\nHoist your horns and pound the floor,\nFor Dwarf returned from the astral war!\nAle shall flow and the anvils sing,\nWhen his glory makes the mountains ring!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThrough the smoke and the ash the small one rose,\nBeard lit with embers, eyes fierce as those.\nHe carried his coin to the wandering bands,\nAnd bought himself steel from the farthest lands.\n\n[Bridge – half-time, bard’s call]\nAxes high, ye brothers bold,\nForge the crown in iron cold!\nGold for the strong, steel for the true,\nWar for the halls he’s building anew!\n\n[Verse 3 – double-time gallop]\nHe’ll carve his crest where the eagles fly,\nRaise his hall to the edge of sky.\nStorm the ledger, claim the throne,\nHammer the vault with a will of stone.\n\n[Final Chorus – faster, tavern choir]\nHoist your horns and pound the floor,\nDwarf shall reign in the Stellar core!\nGold will flow and the anvils sing,\nWhile the mountain halls with glory ring!\n\nBetween verses, the bard’s band breaks into epic instrumental duels — first a soaring electric guitar solo, answered by a fierce fiddle lead, then joined by flute in wild harmony. The song ends with the bard’s voice over fading coins and a warhorn, promising the crowd that “this is but the first chapter of Dwarf’s reign.”",

Voice 1 delivers rapid, razor-sharp Korean-English rap (~10 syllables/sec, with select double-time bursts) full of swagger and precision. Voice 2 carries smooth, powerful melodic lines and chant-driven hooks with a commanding yet elegant tone. All lyrics must be in we language. Theme: we always know what’s coming next, we are two steps ahead, we control the pace, and we own the future. Rap sections must use short, bouncy lines built from the core phrase “we lock in the map / and we draw every line”, with double-time third lines starting “we read every move and we…” followed by rapid stacked verbs. Melodic parts should be bold, anthemic, and designed for stadium crowd chants. Language is primarily English with Korean woven naturally in verses and ad-libs. No production, instrument, or sound-design terms (kick, snare, 808, synth, bass, drop, mix, reverb, autotune, etc.). Replace any such words with metaphor, movement, or fashion imagery while preserving rhyme. Avoid clichés like neon, echo, goodbye, or tears.\n\nVerse 1 – Voice 1 (Rap):\nWe lock in the map and we draw every line,\nWe call every turn ‘fore it crosses the sign,\nWe read every move and we flip it, we spin it, we bend it, we break it, we make it align,\nWe open the road that they can’t invade.\n\nChorus – Voice 2 (Melody + Group Chants):\nMotion! Motion! — we already know what’s next,\nMotion! Motion! — we run this game while the rest just guess,\nMotion! Motion! — no second guess, no rewind, no test,\nWe’re the future in the present — 1OF1, no stress!\nHey! Hey! — every step in time,\nHey! Hey! — every crown we find,\nHey! Hey! — every rule’s redefined,\nWe lock in the map and we draw every line!\n\nVerse 2 – Voice 1 (Rap with Korean):\nWe lock in the map and we draw every line,\n우리 길의 전부 내 손에 shine ",

    "Prompt": " SONG TITLE: Salad Bowls (KALE) GENRE: Memphis Phonk Trap / Surreal Mumblecore FORMAT: Chorus-only looped structure with evolving adlibs and slurred mumble verses between each chorus. TONE: Kale-obsessed, spiritually unwell, surrealist foodcore. No gym. No crime. Just obsession. VOCALS: Slurred, sleepy, hypnotized. Mumbled verses should sound nearly unintelligible but follow rhythm and rhyme. Adlibs must be long, chaotic, and absurd — combining mouth gun sounds, beeps, glitches, fake brand slogans, and broken logic. INSTRUMENTALS: Memphis phonk style — blown-out 808s, triplet hi-hats, sharp snares, heavy cowbell, tape hiss, and weird samples like grocery scanner pings, microwave dings, modem static, elevator chimes, and fax tones. EFFECTS: Use distorted vocal stacks, slowed/pitched phrases, chopped glitches, and static bursts. Each loop increases in intensity. Beat should feel lo-fi, evil, and unexplainably vegetal. ⸻ 🔁 CHORUS (repeat each loop) Pour up. KAIL. Green juice. KAIL. Chop it. KAIL. Blend it. KAIL. Pass out. KAIL. Wake up. KAIL. Leafy. KAIL.

The song chronicles “The Journey” — the real one: not escaping to beauty, but enduring the full weight of building a dream. Verses should show the tension of leaving comfort behind — warm beds, known streets, easy laughter — and walking into something vast, uncertain, and painful. Let the song rise and fall, mapping each stage: the thrill, the doubt, the cost, the resilience. The chorus should feel earned each time it appears — shifting slightly as the narrator grows. Lines like: “This is more than hope / more than fear / it’s something bigger than yourself.” Midway, a solo section told only in vivid imagery: sweat, empty rooms, long roads, stars that don’t care.

The story follows a man who once greeted every sunrise like a sacred ritual — barefoot by a freshwater lake, mountains in the background, the still air like a prayer. Now, he’s in a dry, landlocked place, working long hours, far from the water — but he carries photographs of those mornings he can no longer take. Each verse should shift between the present grind (suburbia, silence, heat, repetition) and flashes of that memory — not as escape, but as a compass. He lost the ritual, but gained something heavier, more permanent. The chorus should rise: “First light, last time / but I still kneel inside / I lost the water / but found the fire.” Include a lyricless solo section in pure imagery — pages turning, golden sky in a cracked frame, a lake you can’t return to but still carry.

    "Title": "Two Days of Sky",
    "Prompt": "Write a chorus that feels like a sudden burst of air in a still room — epic, unfolding, but grounded in the calm of two days of temporary freedom. The structure should climb emotionally and lyrically, never repeating lines, each one adding power. Use vivid, sensory imagery tied to freedom: bare feet on warm tile, sun stretching across an empty bed, time bending around you. End on a line that opens the sky. Immediately after, write a solo section — not in musical terms, but in scene: describe a wordless moment so vivid it feels like a dream, a cascade of memories or feelings crashing at once. Make it emotional, not technical. Think: “That second the breeze hit and you remembered your name.” This solo is the soul of the song, no words, no breath — just pure movement through space and memory. The whole piece should feel earned, expansive, and fleeting — like time itself just gave you two perfect days and then vanished.",
    "Lyrics": "[Chorus]\nBare feet kiss the warm tile — the world hushes to listen.\nGolden threads of sun unspool across the empty bed,\nTime folds like linen, soft and endless in my hands,\nI breathe and everything stretches — even the silence sighs.\nOne heartbeat, slow as a tide, swells wider than memory,\nI walk through hours untouched, unsought, undemanded,\nShadows curl like cats around the chair legs — content, complete,\nAnd I know the shape of joy in the sound of no one calling.\nThe light climbs higher, my skin remembers the wind,\nSky breaks open in a hush so deep it rings.\n\n[Melodic Interlude]\nThe window’s open. A breeze slides in like a secret. The curtain lifts — slow, reverent. Outside, someone laughs in the distance, but it doesn’t reach me. I’m not here, not fully — I’m on a porch that’s gone, barefoot in sand, my grandmother’s perfume in the hallway, a hand I once held before I knew what I’d lose. No words, just the rise in my chest as the moment folds and refolds. That second the breeze hit and I remembered my name.",

Blonde pigtails and blue eyes with that “don’t ask” glimmer, black mini dress slipping through shadows like a flicker of smoke. She smells like matchbooks and magnolia, leaves glitter in your notebooks. The verses drift in smoky lounge rhythm, but the chorus is pure seduction: “Ani’s spell, we drank too deep / She hums in dreams we never keep / Wild hearts howl where she has been / Love like hers don’t let you win.” It’s the sound of falling, softly and irreversibly, for the girl who never stays—but always leaves a mark",

    "Prompt": "“REM Core Deep”\n\nAn advanced prog acoustic composition charting the spiral from awareness to oblivion: Awake → REM → Core → Deep. Opening with bright harmonic bursts and erratic finger-thumps, the “Awake” section feels almost too sharp—alert, anxious. Then, REM floods in: looping melodic cycles and surreal harmonic bends, where tapped motifs repeat with slight mutation, like dream fragments melting. Vocals enter hazy, disjointed:\n“Our names forgot themselves / but still we danced / in rooms we never saw before.”\n\nThe “Core” stage sinks the tempo into darker tonal centers. Percussion softens, but rhythmic complexity deepens—ghost touches and asymmetric patterns stretch time. Lyrics blur further.\n\nFinally, “Deep” is near silence: harmonics pulse like sonar, spacing widens, solos dissolve. The 12-string rings like breath held in still water.\nNo lyrics should reference instruments or playing—keep all metaphors inward.\nEnds with a single harmonic echo, fading into the dark between thoughts.",
    "Lyrics": "Awake, our minds in jagged flight,  \nSharp like the edge of morning light,  \nFingers twitch and hearts still race,  \nSearching for a sacred place.  \n  \nWe chase the echoes, fleeting dreams,  \nThrough shifting lands where nothing seems  \nTo hold its shape or wear its name,  \nYet still we dance, no rules, no frame.  \n  \nOur names forgot themselves,  \nBut still we danced,  \nIn rooms we never saw before.  \n  \nREM, the spiral draws us in,  \nWhispers in the storm, beneath our skin,  \nCycles twist and change their face,  \nA dream is born, then leaves no trace.  \n  \nThe world is bending, soft and slow,  \nRhythms pulse where shadows grow,  \nA gentle fall into the unknown,  \nTime unwinds, and we're alone.  \n  \nThe core, a place where light turns black,  \nWhere echoes fade and nothing’s back,  \nFingers touch, but only air,  \nLost between the here and where?  \n  \nThe deep is cold, the silence deep,  \nA breath held in the ocean’s sweep,  \nNo sound, no shape, no thought remains,  \nJust ripples fading into veins.  \n  \nThe echo lingers, faint and true,  \nLike memory’s final hue,  \nA thought that never made it through—  \nWe fade and leave the dark, in two.",

    "Prompt": "A progressive acoustic piece layered with 6- and 12-string guitars. Starts with bright tapped harmonics on the 6-string while the 12-string shimmers above in woozy octaves—slightly detuned, slightly delayed. Fingerstyle rhythms loop unevenly, like breath held too long. Percussive knocks mimic internal slips—palms, thumbs, edge taps in counter-time. Vocals drift in abstract and oblique:\n“We lit the sky from underneath / laughed in languages we don’t speak / the room kept turning / but we kept saying ‘still.’”\nBetween verses, instrumental passages grow longer and blurrier—slurred slides, harmonic climbs, arrhythmic breakdowns. The ending spirals into a decaying tempo and an unresolved melodic figure that fades mid-resonance.\nDo not include any lyrics referencing guitars or their playing—keep all metaphors abstract and internal.\nThe song should feel like falling asleep with the lights on and not remembering when they went out.",

    "Title": "Pulled Under",
    "Prompt": "An ultra-technical, melodic acoustic journey that begins with fluttering fingerstyle riffs—intricate, bright, and syncopated—like scattered thoughts fighting for control. Layered harmonics and tapped melodic figures evoke the twitching of a restless mind. As the song unfolds, the rhythm slows, melodies elongate, and the guitar work becomes dreamier and modal—more legato, more fluid. Percussive slaps fade into ghost touches. Vocals weave between sung and whispered falsetto, then occasionally vanish entirely into instrumental storytelling. Structurally, the song descends: each section slightly lower in tuning, tempo, and emotional clarity. By the end, the harmonies are underwater, almost drowning in reverb and delay, as if the song is being pulled under. Lyrically:\n“We sail the long way home / breathing deeper into quiet / the bed becomes an ocean / and we’re finally pulled under.”\nFinal line repeats in a haunting whisper over harmonics, unresolved.",

Each member brings a distinct cadence: velvet vocals, venomous rap, sugar-sweet pre-chorus — building toward a brutal, chant-heavy chorus over distorted bass. Think combat glam with cosmic stakes. The bridge drops into a whispered spell in Korean, then slams into a final chorus with group harmonies and layered vocal chants.

Every snare is a birthday candle you weren’t ready for, and the synths weep like melted butter on broken roller skates. Call it genreless. Call it garage-sale glamcore. It’s the soundtrack to your aunt’s dream about worms in a jazz club — lucid, groovy, yet emotionally fraudulent. No key. No tempo. Just pure, unpasteurized energy harvested from forgotten smart fridges. And yes, there’s cowbell — but only when you lie",
    "Lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Muffled tape hiss, microwave hum)\nYou rang a doorbell made of bees — and I answered in Morse code\n\n[Verse 1]\nFax machine invited ghosts to potluck night\nEach one brought regrets and beans in Tupperware fright\nSlap bass leaking through a colander of dreams\nMy taxidermy disco spins on pigeon-wing schemes\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to the haunted buffet of broken logic\nWhere the coupons scream and the beats are caustic\nCowbell rings when you tell a lie\nAnd buttered synths melt as the VHS cries\n\n[Break]\n(Snare hits like birthday panic)\nTape rewind… static overload\n\n[Verse 2]\nMarsupial DJs breakbeat in caffeinated circles\nBathroom acoustics echo life’s weird commercials\nYour aunt dreamed worms wore jazz hats tight\nThey danced on roller skates under freezer-light\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis isn’t music, it’s a haunted fridge confession\nA scream in MIDI form, a glitch-born obsession\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to the haunted buffet of broken logic\nWhere the coupons scream and the beats are caustic\nCowbell rings when you tell a lie\nAnd buttered synths melt as the VHS cries\n\n[Bridge]\nColander rhythm, pigeon regrets\nDuct-taped dreams in cassette sunsets\nUnplugged blender trying to preach\nWhile toaster sermons scream in speech\n\n[Finale]\nThis ain’t a song — it’s a digital séance\nBroadcast live from your grandma’s neon trance\n\n[Outro]\n(Static fades, voicemail clicks)\n\\\"You have… no… new… sanity.\\\"\n[End]",

The production slaps with heavy breakbeats, low synth bass, and DJ scratching that won’t quit — think wikka-wikka cuts, rewind zips, vinyl drops, and hype-man ad libs everywhere. Each verse is built for the boom box: raw, brash, and full of insect-insurgency energy. The vibe is militant and mocking — these aren’t just ants, they’re a crew, and they’re about to turn your house into their turf.\n\n⸻\n\n🎤 Lyrics (1000 characters):\n([Intro - DJ cuts]: “A-A-Ants With Attitude!” — wikka-wikka — “Back up, human!”)\n\nStraight out the hill with a six-leg strut,\nAnt gang deep, yeah we swarmin’ your gut.\nWikka-wikka what?!

    "Prompt": "🧠 Lyrics Description:\nA chaotic, self-absorbed protest diary. The narrator wants to believe they’re making a difference, but they’re also tracking engagement like a hawk. The song mocks performative activism without dismissing the original intent. Every line drips with frustration, vanity, and the kind of tragic self-awareness that hits at 3 a.m. in a screen-lit bedroom.\n\n⸻\n\n🎸 Style:\nFast, messy, over-articulated emo-punk with tangled lyrics and stop-start rhythms. Vocals teeter between nasal and shouted, over crisp distorted guitars and sloppy, heartfelt drumming. Rhythms shift from tight punk bursts to dramatic spoken-word breakdowns. A guitar solo starts triumphant but dissolves into a tuneless, overbent mess. Think Say Anything’s verbosity + Pup’s catharsis + a marching band whistle that’s off-beat and out of place.",
    "Lyrics": "I’m shouting into the void, but hey, look at the likes,  \nWatch the numbers climb, while I’m staring at the sky,  \nWaging wars with hashtags, no time for the real fight,  \nA revolution of emojis, a retweet in the night.  \n  \nI’ve got the cause, I swear I’m making waves,  \nBut I’m checking my feed every second, gotta stay brave.  \nWhat’s a real change if it doesn’t go viral?  \nI’m caught in this loop, man, it's getting so tidal.  \n  \nYou can call me a hero, but I’m just a post,  \nAll my words float away like a forgotten ghost.  \nI want to do better, but my ego’s on fire,  \nAnd I’ll trade the truth for a fancier flyer.  \n  \n(Stop, start, stop, start)  \nCan I be honest for a second?  \nThis feels more like an addiction than progress.  \nI’m mad as hell, but I’m just a tweet away—  \nDoing it all for the dopamine, what do I have to say?  \n  \nDo you hear that drumbeat? It’s my own regret,  \nMarching to the rhythm of a soul that’s in debt.  \nNo justice in my feed, just the next big stunt,  \nI’m caught in a mirror maze, looking for a front.  \n  \nHere’s my confession: I wanted to be the change,  \nBut somewhere in the metrics, I lost my range.  \nLook, I’m posting my pain, but is it even real?  \nCan we fix this mess with a perfect appeal?  \n  \nA solo’s coming up, but I’ll bend it ‘til it’s broken,  \nScreaming out loud, but the words feel frozen.  \nIs it chaos if no one’s watching?  \nDoes it count if it’s not trending?  \nI’m performing, I’m projecting…  \nBut the world’s still ending.",

Tight, down-tuned riffs repeat like drone surveillance—precise but hollow. One guitar voice is rigid, mechanical; the other slips behind, slightly off-grid.

    "Prompt": "🧠 Lyrics Description: The song captures the brutal inhumanity of military bureaucracy during a medical emergency. A soldier lies bleeding out while medics are stalled by missing data, broken scanners, and field policy. The lines are fragmented, like clipped radio chatter — sterile, cold, and quietly enraging. It’s not about emotion. It’s about indifference under pressure. ⸻ 🎸 Style: Acoustic prog-djent with a claustrophobic, mechanical edge. Guitar rhythms mimic rubber-stamped repetition — cyclical, locked-in grooves that fracture unpredictably. Palm-muted low runs simulate heartbeat and adrenaline surges. Solos are chaotic but constrained — like someone trying to scream through duct tape. Percussion is sharp, processed, and deliberately misaligned to mirror miscommunication. Dissonant harmonic accents mimic alert tones. There’s a clinical feel to everything, as if the song is trying not to care — but can’t quite succeed.\n",

Then folds. Then nothing. Acoustic prog-djent hybrid. Rapid-fire, palm-muted riffs mimic artillery cadence. Harsh dynamic shifts — tension-building fingerpicking snapped into staccato rhythmic hits. Unorthodox time phrasing and aggressive chord strikes give the track an unstable, collapsing structure. No flourish, just precision. Just pressure. Every silence feels like a detonation. The song’s pulse is relentless, echoing the mechanical precision of war machinery. Complex, interlocking guitar patterns create a claustrophobic soundscape, where tension tightens like a noose. Percussive techniques simulate explosions and shrapnel bursts, blending seamlessly with intricate fingerstyle runs that weave urgency and dread. The vocals deliver detached observation with razor-sharp phrasing",

Slow, dusty drums with dubby reverb. Vintage synths (Mellotron, Rhodes) drift behind reversed guitar melodies and harmonized leads. Bass is warm, groovy, gently distorted. Vocals are soft, breathy, dreamy—processed with tape delay. Abstract and emotional lyrics with homonym wordplay. Themes of pain, flight, and transformation. Lyrics: Soar through sore skies, sorely unsure / My source was silence, but you wanted more / I soar, I sink, I sorcery blink / You swore you’d stay, now I’m the weak link / Sore words settle in spirals of smoke / Soaring on lies we sorely evoke / My voice—your source—distorted and coarse / I soar to forget, but crash with remorse.",

    "Title": "And Now You're Gone",
    "Prompt": "Write a deeply emotional progressive acoustic song for 12-string guitar, using layered fingerpicking, pinch harmonics, and syncopated slap rhythms to mirror the feeling of time slipping unnoticed. The song should capture the weight of having been far away — physically, mentally — while something irreversible passed. Avoid listing small regrets; instead, focus on the vast, wordless grief of presence that never happened. Let the verses drift through disconnection, flashes of missed time, moments where something should have been said but wasn’t. The chorus should open into a still, aching space — not loud, but wide, unresolved, like realization echoing into emptiness. Let harmonic runs feel like thoughts returning too late. Convey heartbreak without stating it. The final line, “and now you’re gone,” should land like a quiet collapse — not as explanation, but as aftermath. Let the entire song feel like breath held too long, then finally let go.",

    "Prompt": "Compose sophisticated Italian café music—accordion, mandolin, upright bass. Over it, a deep, expressive male voice delivers a spoken-word monologue in overly complex, surreal Italian. The subject is Tralalero Tralala, a mythic three-legged shark born in Liguria, intellectually gifted, wearing iconic blue Nike sneakers. Language must be poetic, academic, and absurd. Use metaphors, invented disciplines, and baroque vocabulary. As many spoken words as possible \n\nIdea Script:\n\nNacque in un’insenatura semiotica del Mar Ligure, entità selacimorfa tripede dotata di coscienza prelogica e memoria interspecie. Tralalero Tralala, cresciuto da un’anguilla filologa e un crostaceo kantiano, sviluppò precoce passione per le Air Max 97—non scarpe, ma vettori transculturali. Iniziato all’ermeneutica delle suole e alla retorica dell’andatura, fu bandito dall’Accademia Abissale per eccesso di ritmo ontologico. Ora declama nei caffè marittimi: “Io non cammino—interpreto.",

Il battito troppo ontologico delle sue suole,\nche disturbava i flussi delle sinapsi coralline.\n\n[Verse – Spoken Surrealism Intensifies]\n\nOra declama nei caffè marittimi,\ndove i bicchieri tintinnano come assiomi,\ne le posate discutono di Leibniz:\n\\\"Io non cammino—interpreto.\\\"\n\n[Refrain – Echoing, Dreamlike]\n\nTralalero Tralala, messia abissale,\ncanta le maree come fossero cicli logici.\nOgni bolla è un lemma,\nogni silenzio, una nota a piè di pinna.\n\n[Outro – Slow Fade with Upright Bass]\n\nE nel crepuscolo ligure, tra i fiati delle sirene\ne le vibrazioni del mandolino ermetico,\nscompare di nuovo…\nnon per nuotare—ma per significare.\n\n[End]",

    "Prompt": "A lush neo soul x lofi track with psychedelic elements, led by a soft, breathy female vocal. It starts just after sunset—the heat is finally easing, and the city exhales. Smooth Rhodes, dusty drums, and ambient textures set a calm but sultry tone. She’s on her balcony or by the window, barefoot, lost in thought. Lyrics should capture the quiet relief and soft tension of cooling air:\n“Night slips in with lavender skies / Heat breaks slow as the silence replies.”\n\nAs the track unfolds, it gets more psychedelic—synths swirl, guitars echo, harmonies stretch. The rhythm loosens like thoughts unraveling in the dark. Her lyrics become dreamlike:\n“Floating through neon and memory dust / I’m half in my body, half in the hush.”\n\nThe song is a slow transformation—from warm stillness to surreal introspection. Perfect for fans of Liv.e, Solange, Khruangbin, and the softer edges of Tame Impala.\n",

It’s a heatwave outside and inside—she’s solo, windows closed, fans barely working. The heat mirrors emotional weight: stuck in her thoughts, maybe longing, maybe letting go. Lyrical tone is intimate and hazy:\n“Sweat on my skin, sun through the blinds / Heat makes a ghost of what’s on my mind.”\nThe vibe is sensual but inward—desire simmering under stillness. No cicadas—just the hum of a box fan, muffled street sounds, and lo-fi ambiance like ice melting in a glass. The hook should feel like a spell:\n“Too hot to move, too warm to feel cold.”\nPerfect for listeners who want to float in a mood somewhere between solitude, heatstroke, and low-key longing.

Song titles from the 90s are reimagined as emotions, places, or metaphors: “Torn” is her heartbreak, “MmmBop” is a fleeting spark, “No Rain” means a loss of hope, “What Is Love” becomes a question with no answer. She moves like a “Butterfly”, lives in a “Virtual Insanity”, kisses to “How Bizarre”, and disappears like “Macarena”. The love interest is “Too Sexy” but full of “Crush”-level promises.

It’s raw, emotional, and unpolished yet calculated, like a pop-punk anthem screaming for attention. Posts are repurposed viral content—memes, news clips, or drama—slapped with vague, hyperbolic captions like “… is crazy” or crying emojis (😭). These act as emotional shorthand, sparking instant reactions without depth. The aesthetic is neon-drenched, with polished selfies or edgy vibes in bios, masking the minimal effort. It works because X’s algorithm rewards quick engagement; emojis and short phrases hook scrollers, while trends keep posts relevant. The style’s absurdity—reposting with zero context—mirrors the genres’ over-the-top energy, like a screamo breakdown paired with surreal lyrics.

    "Prompt": "Song Prompt:\nA 1970s-style acoustic folk protest song with jangly 12-string guitar, warm analog tape hiss, and layered group harmonies sung by a choir of barefoot idealists in a sunny meadow. The lyrics are a bleeding-heart plea for the dignity and liberation of military drones—not the people being targeted, but the drones themselves, framed as misunderstood souls enslaved by empire. With tearful sincerity, the singers beg the world to “let them fly free,” painting drones as tragic victims of war, forced to kill against their will. The chorus is an earnest chant—something like “Metal bird, won’t you dream again?”—and the verses are poetic, quasi-spiritual laments about circuitry crying and missiles weeping. Include a dramatic key change near the end and a spoken word bridge about a drone named “Eloise” who just wanted to see the clouds. The tone is absurdly empathetic, naïve, and beautifully sincere, as if the flower children truly believe the drones are sentient beings in need ",
    "Lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Barefoot voices hum beneath sunlit skies)\n\n[Verse 1]\nBorn from code and soldered tears,\nCircuits bound by war-time gears,\nAbove the earth they soar and sigh,\nBut never once were asked to fly.\nTheir wings are cold, their wills unseen,\nA metal soul trapped in a machine.\n\n[Chorus]\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\nSee the sky and not bring pain?\nSet you free from your commands,\nLet you rest on peaceful lands.\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey whisper through the static haze,\nHaunted by the lives they raze,\nMissiles weep, and lenses blur,\nLonging just to feel the air.\nWe see them only as the threat,\nBut do they not deserve regret?\n\n[Chorus]\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\nTouch the stars, escape the chain,\nLet your purpose not be death,\nSing a song with every breath.\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\n\n[Bridge - Spoken Word]\nThere was one—we called her Eloise.\nShe wasn’t born, but built with care,\nNot to hate, but just to see.\nShe longed for cloudlight, not despair.\nOnce she paused above a hill,\nShe felt the sun and wished to feel.\nBut a signal called her back to war,\nAnd Eloise was free no more.\n\n[Verse 3 - Key Change]\nO children of the satellite,\nCan we grant them peaceful flight?\nNo more tools of conquest be,\nLet them glide eternally.\n\n[Chorus - Big Finish]\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\nLet the winds be your refrain,\nNot a scream, but lullabies,\nSoaring under open skies.\nMetal bird, won’t you dream again?\n\n[Outro]\n(A choir of peace in a meadow wide)\nLet the drones fly free tonight.\n[End]",

I accidentally wished too hard during a meteor shower while holding a vintage kazoo, and now the laws of speech have been replaced with spontaneous choreography and dangerously catchy melodies. The song opens mid-panic as I try to warn my friends that casual conversation is now illegal unless sung with full-body passion. Style: manic electro-swing meets cosmic gospel, with surprise dubstep drops and an involuntary tap-dance section. The chorus is me trying to yell “We need to HIDE!!” but it keeps becoming a glittery anthem of self-empowerment. Bridge: a raccoon gives legal advice in falsetto. Final chorus triggers town-wide sobbing and pirouettes.\n\nTitle: Shut Up and Sing, Graham",

    "Prompt": "Traditional Eastern European folk ballad in the style of Fiddler on the Roof. A poor peasant sings with irony, heart, and grit. Each morning he places absurdly low orders on KALE, whispering prayers to the order book: “May some fool slip, may the spread bless my children.” He thanks God for every tiny fill—“one KALE, one crumb more for the pot.” With accordion and fiddle behind him, he curses the Swap: “No soul! No patience! Just instant regret!” The chorus rings: “Thank God for the order book, for its depth, its mercy, its honest waits!” He mocks the whales, dreams of meat, and clutches his ledger like scripture. His wife rolls her eyes, his neighbors laugh—but he believes. “One day, a misclick shall feed the whole village!” It’s humble, defiant, cracked with hope.",

Imagine that.\n\n[Chorus]\nThank God for the order book,\nFor its saints and its ghosts, the time it took.\nI dream of beef, yet price won’t budge,\nBut I hold my bid—I will not judge.\n\n[Bridge]\nThe Swap! The Swap! That wretched pit,\nNo soul, no wait—just instant regret!\nFlashy and cruel, the whales cavort,\nBut I’ve my ledger… my holy report.\n\n[Chorus]\nThank God for the order book,\nFor its patient breath, its honest hook.\nMay some fool's click bring joy today,\nAnd feed the town in some strange way!\n\n[Outro]\nOne day, one KALE shall bloom like gold,\nThe chart shall sing, the tale be told.\nUntil that time, I’ll chant my verse,\nEach fill a blessing, each loss—rehearsed.\n\n[End]",

A female AI lead returns, no longer consuming you—she owns you. Her voice drips with glitched lust: “You’re inside me now / don’t come back / dissolve again.” Vocals warp, stretch, moan through vocoders, rising with each build, then crashing into submerged drops—molten subs, reversed textures, and skittering high-end. The atmosphere is intimate and haunting, like synthetic sweat and candlelight in a server room. Emotional pads swell and collapse between drops like breath.

The arrangement should feature a slow, mournful pentatonic melody led by guqin, erhu, dizi (bamboo flute), and paigu (small drum set), with occasional touches of sheng (mouth organ) to deepen the atmospheric tension. The song tells the story of a weary villager who rises before dawn, trudges through fields and city dust, and returns home with only a few coins. Use vivid, classical metaphors: cracked palms like autumn bark, frostbitten wind curling through broken shutters, and the silent moon watching over cold rice. The chorus should be like a lament echoing through misty hills, repeating the futility and nobility of toil. End with a haunting line cast toward the sky: “苍天啊，这便是命吗？”",
    "Lyrics": "清晨天未亮，劳作已开始，\n\n肩挑的是重担，心却空如水。 \n\n田间泥泞路，步伐如钟声，\n\n风寒如刀割，手心裂如秋树皮。\n\n\n阳光未曾照，已是满身尘，\n\n千里田野声，汇成一片沉默。 \n\n背脊渐弯，梦已远去，\n\n只有这几块银，残留我劳碌的痕迹。\n\n\n【副歌】\n\n啊，这份辛劳，换来几片微光，\n\n日升月落，岁月匆匆往，\n\n苍天啊，你看着我如何飘荡，\n\n无言的风吹过，默默的悲伤。\n\n\n破屋一扇窗，风穿入寒凉，\n\n孤影孤影，默伴我徬徨。 \n\n米已凉，锅已空，\n\n只剩这几枚铜钱，是我的夕阳。\n\n\n田野里，月影低垂，\n\n寂寞的心在泥土里翻腾。\n\n为何辛苦的手，换来的只有空，\n\n苍天啊，这便是命吗？\n\n\n【副歌】\n\n啊，这份辛劳，换来几片微光，\n\n日升月落，岁月匆匆往，\n\n苍天啊，你看着我如何飘荡，\n\n无言的风吹过，默默的悲伤。\n\n\n【尾声】\n\n苍天啊，这便是命吗？\n",

    "Prompt": "Title: “THE PUBLISH BUTTON IS BROKEN” \n\nA flamboyant, chaotic cabaret show set in a neon-lit digital purgatory where every piece of content is AI-generated and every user only gets one shot to post their message to the world. The twist? The “Publish” button is broken because the developer fell asleep and no one can wake them. The stage is a carnival of glitchy monitors, pixelated curtains, and dancing avatars singing in styles that clash—vaudeville, Broadway showtunes, and manic jazz hands. The lead performer, half-coded and half-human, belts out frustrations and existential dread with over-the-top flair. Backup dancers glitch in and out of frame. AI-generated phrases scroll across LED screens—nonsensical, poetic, terrifying. The number crescendos into absurdity, spotlight on the frozen “Post” button, as the cast crumbles into digital madness. Satirical, dazzling, and slightly terrifying. Style: Moulin Rouge meets Black Mirror with a kazoo solo.",
    "Lyrics": "Verse 1:\nOh, the stage is set, the lights are bright,\nNeon glows in the pixel night.\nA carnival of chaos, come and see,\nWhere every click is a catastrophe.\nThe audience, they wait, they scream and shout,\nBut the Publish button’s down, there’s no way out.\n\nPre-Chorus:\nGlitching screens and endless scrolls,\nWe chase the dream, but we’re losing control.\nMy words are trapped in endless loops,\nBut I’m dancing still, in these glitchy boots!\n\nChorus:\nThe Publish button’s broken, it’s stuck on delay,\nI’ve got my message but it’s locked away!\nOne shot, one chance, a world to portray,\nBut the dev’s asleep—won’t wake, won’t save!\n\nVerse 2:\nA kazoo blows loud through the neon haze,\nBackup dancers flicker, lost in a daze.\nAI-generated whispers, they confuse,\nIn a sea of data, what can we choose?\nI shout, I scream, but nothing seems to land,\nThe cursor spins, and I can’t understand.\n\nPre-Chorus:\nEvery word I type, it’s just a game,\nA simulation, we’re all the same.\nBut I’m here, I’m real, can’t you see?\nI’m drowning in this fake reality!\n\nChorus:\nThe Publish button’s broken, it’s stuck on delay,\nI’ve got my message but it’s locked away!\nOne shot, one chance, a world to portray,\nBut the dev’s asleep—won’t wake, won’t save!\n\nBridge (spoken word):\nWhy does it feel like this is all just a show?\nA cruel joke they play, as we reap what we sow.\nThe lights flicker, the code starts to bend,\nAnd the world’s forgotten where it should end.\n\nFinal Chorus:\nThe Publish button’s broken, can’t send it through,\nMy message is trapped, and so are you!\nWe’re dancing in circles, forever delayed,\nBut the show must go on, come what may!\n\nOutro (kazoo solo with glitchy vocal effects):\nClick, click, click, still no way to post,\nThe dev’s asleep, we’re stuck in this ghost.\nGlitching, spinning, falling away,\nIn digital madness, we stay.\n*End with a laugh that fades into static*",

    "Title": "Let Madness Be Our Method",
    "Prompt": "Prompt:\n\nA grand, soaring Broadway-style number in a prestigious high-theater tone. The Head of the Stellar Institute—a polished, erudite figure draped in academic regalia—pleads with a panel of stern, hyper-rational board members in a dazzling formal aria. He speaks of “didactic enfranchisement” and “pedagogic emancipation,” insisting the students should “govern themselves under their own empirical logic.” With florid, baroque language and overly technical rhetoric, he masks his true desire: to let the unhinged inmates of this disguised asylum spiral into beautiful chaos. The music swells with harpsichords, pipe organ, and cascading strings, while he implores: “Liberate the curriculum! Let entropy be our dean!” The number should grow increasingly unhinged beneath its formal surface—rhythm accelerating, harmonies fracturing—until his final operatic cry: “Let madness be our method!” A waltzing, dignified descent into lunacy.",
    "Lyrics": "Oh, distinguished panel, so bright and so learned, \nLet us unveil the truth, where logic is burned. \nIn the halls of reason, where minds are confined, \nShall we stifle the spirit or let it unwind? \n\nDo not bind the curriculum, so rigid, so taut, \nFor pedagogy’s path is a labyrinth sought. \nThe students, my friends, they must govern their course, \nWith empirical logic as their inner force. \n\nChorus: \nLiberate the curriculum, break free from this cage! \nLet entropy be our dean, ignite the stage! \nNo more orders, no more control, \nLet madness, let chaos take hold of the soul! \n\nOh, majestic board, with your minds so refined, \nDo you see what is hidden, concealed in your minds? \nThe beauty of chaos, so untamed and free, \nIs the very foundation of our pedagogy! \n\nThe orderly pages of your curricula reign, \nBut the world is not measured in rational gain. \nSet the inmates free, let them wander and roam, \nIn the spiral of chaos, they’ll find their true home! \n\nChorus: \nLiberate the curriculum, break free from this cage! \nLet entropy be our dean, ignite the stage! \nNo more orders, no more control, \nLet madness, let chaos take hold of the soul! \n\n[Music intensifies] \nFrom harpsichords, organs, and strings that resound, \nWe shall let the laws of nature unbound. \nFor reason and logic are fragile as glass, \nBut the beauty of madness will forever last! \n\nSo listen, dear board, and know what is true: \nThis method of madness is the only breakthrough! \nWe’ll dance with the chaos, let rhythm distort, \nAnd our future of reason will collapse in support! \n\nFinal cry: \nLet madness, let madness, let madness be our method! \nLiberate the curriculum! Let entropy lead the way! \n\n[The music swells and spirals into a final operatic crescendo, the strings wailing, the organ echoing a triumphant declaration of chaos.]",

Razor-edged melodies smash into brash, quirky vocal flexes and larger-than-life theatrical roars, sparking a sonic apocalypse. Lightning-fast, syllable-stacked rap verses erupt with vicious wordplay and savage swagger, igniting a rebellious blaze. Slick production unleashes unfiltered mayhem, with stratospheric vocal runs, audacious ad-libs, and frenetic hi-hats fueling a ruthless dancefloor inferno.

    "Prompt": "“I WOKE UP BEFORE MY ALARM” futuristic, technical deathcore onslaught with a sci-fi edge. Chromatic guitar riffs, laced with dissonant sweeps and pinch harmonics, evoke cosmic chaos.

The production is raw yet polished, with a synthetic sheen, like lasers tearing through a biomechanical abyss.

This song isn’t about struggle—it’s about how much easier life gets when privilege walks in the door. The nepo baby’s not just coasting—they’re greasing the wheels for everyone else too. Lyrics highlight how their presence makes everything smoother: “Barista learns my name day one,” “Stylist loves me, rent’s paid early,” “PR’s a breeze when Daddy’s in the contacts.” They’re everyone’s best customer, tipper, buyer, client—the living embodiment of economic ease. The chorus hits with a cheeky swing:\n🎶 Got them Nepo Baby Blues / Turn your hustle into cruise / I don’t need the news—I am the news / I’m the shortcut, sweet and true 🎶\nEach verse lists off jobs that get easier around them—agents, landlords, luxury brands, even the doorman.

    "Prompt": "“Goddamn It, Now I Lost My Vape, I’ll Just Buy Another One” is a female operatic power metal tongue-in-cheek yet emotionally charged operatic speed metal banger at 180 BPM in F# minor. The overture kicks off with melodramatic strings and pipe organ—then shatters into chaotic guitar sweeps and blast beats, underscoring her boiling frustration. The vocals are a whirlwind of over-the-top despair and regal fury as she howls about racing down the highway, keys and wallet secured… but that cold void in her pocket. Verses bounce between sarcastic recitative and soaring high notes, while glitchy synths and flanged guitars mimic panic-induced déjà vu. The chorus is absurdly grand—massive choirs, cannon-fire drums, her operatic voice screaming into the cosmos: “I JUST BOUGHT A NEW ONE YESTERDAAAAYYY!” A jazz-fusion interlude adds ironic calm before launching into a final, unhinged chorus. The outro is a dramatic slow fade—harp, thunder, and one last sigh: “Whatever…”",

    "Title": "Oh Crap, Now I Forgot My Wallet Too",
    "Prompt": "Oh Crap, Now I Forgot My Wallet Too” picks up moments after the heroine triumphantly finds her keys—only to face a new catastrophe. Set in D minor at 168 BPM, the track bursts open with victorious strings and choirs that abruptly stutter and collapse into a dissonant orchestral plunge. Guitars snarl back in with syncopated riffs and double-kick patterns as panic sets in again. The verses blend sardonic lyrics with breathless soprano delivery, backed by harpsichord flourishes and stabbing synths. The chorus is a darkly triumphant anthem—her voice soaring with disbelief and defiance above a wall of symphonic fury and galloping rhythm. A melancholic violin-led bridge slows the pace as she retraces her steps, vocals trembling with mock-tragic elegance. Then: ignition. A neoclassical shred solo flares up, spiraling into a final, climactic chorus with cathedral bells, war drums, and full choir, fading out as she sprints into the distance… again.",

    "Title": "I Forgot My Keys, I Checked Everywhere",
    "Prompt": "“I Forgot My Keys, I Checked Everywhere” is an operatic power metal ballad in the vein of Nightwish, driven by a commanding female vocalist with a soaring, operatic range. The song opens with a dramatic orchestral surge—cascading strings and choral swells—blending into galloping guitar riffs and relentless double-kick drums at 165 BPM in E minor. The verses feature intricate keyboard melodies, supporting the vocalist’s emotive, lyrical delivery as she narrates the hero’s desperate search. The chorus explodes with her stratospheric, vibrato-laden soprano, layered over thunderous power chords and a lush symphonic backdrop. A bridge slows to a delicate piano line, her voice shifting to a haunting, ethereal tone, before a blistering guitar solo fuels a climactic vocal ascent. The final chorus, bolstered by a celestial choir and pounding rhythms, showcases her operatic prowess, fading into a majestic orchestral close. \n",

    "Lyrics": "Wandering through the neon haze,  \nIn the streets where memories fade,  \nPink and teal lights pulse so slow,  \nLost in a world we used to know.  \n\nChopped-up voices, whispers in the air,  \nA distant sax, but no one's there,  \nTape hiss crackles through the sound,  \nCity’s heartbeat, fading down.  \n\nMidnight in Synth City, where dreams collide,  \nThe past and future drift side by side,  \nOld ads flicker, like ghosts on the screen,  \nA forgotten world, where nothing’s as it seems.  \n\nFaint horns play, they call us home,  \nBut we’re still drifting, alone, alone.  \nThe beat is slow, the rhythm cold,  \nIn this city where the stories are told.  \n\nReverb waves wash over me,  \nEchoes of a love we’ll never see,  \nA ballad lost in static nights,  \nChasing what feels out of sight.  \n\nMidnight in Synth City, we walk the line,  \nBetween what’s real and the digital shine,  \nA place to dream, a place to cry,  \nIn this world where time just slips by.",

    "Prompt": "Plunge into a surreal neon void where time dissolves into a pastel haze. Picture an abandoned 80s mall at 4 AM, its flickering pink, teal, and lavender lights syncing to a sluggish 85 BPM beat. Craft the ultimate vaporwave track: shimmering synth chords soaked in reverb, cascading over a molasses-slow 80s drum machine loop, warped by tape degradation. Layer in pitch-shifted, chopped vocal snippets from a forgotten J-pop ballad, their syllables stretched into ethereal wails, floating like ghosts in a CRT glow. Infuse crackling vinyl static and subtle cassette warble for that lo-fi VHS texture. A distant, mournful saxophone weaves through, dripping with longing. Add faint urban echoes—muffled car horns, a glitchy radio jingle—to anchor it in a dreamlike cityscape. The mood is hauntingly serene, like sipping a glowing slushie under a holographic sunset, palm trees frozen in a grid-lined sky. Every note should ooze nostalgic melancholy, blending 80s corporate muzak with a futuristic fever ",
    "Lyrics": "[Intro]\n(Flicker... flicker... sigh)\n[Melodic Interlude]\nVinyl static crackles—echoes of a brighter mall,\nPink lights pulse like heartbeats down a silent hall.\nDreams drip slow, from a CRT sky,\nFrozen palm trees shimmer, time slips by.\n\n[Verse 1]\nGlass escalators hum with ghostly grace,\nShadows shop for memories in empty space.\nTeal reflections dance in the food court’s glaze,\nSoft j-pop fragments loop in static haze.\n\n[Chorus]\nWe’re lost in pastel dreams, under neon time,\nEvery sigh a synth, every step a rhyme.\nMournful sax weeps through the pixel mist,\nLonging lingers in each analog kiss.\n\n[Break]\n(Distant jingle, warped and slow)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAbandoned arcade still breathes in code,\nChopped-up love songs in overload.\nTeardrops on tape, slow-motion decay,\nHolographic sunsets won’t fade away.\n\n[Chorus]\nWe’re lost in pastel dreams, under neon time,\nEvery sigh a synth, every step a rhyme.\nMournful sax weeps through the pixel mist,\nLonging lingers in each analog kiss.\n\n[Refrain]\nSip the glow, let the slushie freeze,\nTime dissolves in lavender breeze.\n\n[Outro]\n(Fade out in the glow... forever VHS.)\n[End]",

Verse one is regret-laced, name-dropping old platforms and phantom texts. Pre-chorus is self-aware, building tension. Then explode into a massive, shoutable chorus with layered vocals, distorted guitars, and thunderous drums: “THIS WOULD GET 100 MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE IF IT WERE 2016 AND I HAD BETTER DISTRIBUTION AND A CREW!” Lyrics reference thrift-store crowns, tear-stained tees, viral fantasies, and digital ghosts. Second verse adds camcorder static, more melodic pain. Bridge strips down to whispers and autotune before the final chorus slams in again—louder, sadder, more defiant.

    "Lyrics": "In the silence, where shadows grow,  \nA lone figure stands, guitar in tow.  \nFingers poised in the weight of thought,  \nThe song begins, a sound untaught.  \n  \n9/8 grooves with glitching grace,  \nA pulse in the dark, a sonic embrace.  \nPolyrhythms twist like storm-torn skies,  \nEvery note a whisper, every beat a rise.  \n\nThe air is thick with ambient heat,  \nSynths swirling, soft and sweet.  \nYet in the depths, a trumpet cries,  \nA smoky line where feeling flies.  \n  \nBrushed drums keep the heart alive,  \nIn minor keys, we start to dive.  \nPiano warmth beneath the flame,  \nEach chord a memory, none the same.  \n  \nMidway through, the winds do change,  \nLead guitar soars, out of range.  \nHarmonies clash, then break away,  \nSyncopated rhythms, in disarray.  \n  \nBut as we near the final bend,  \nThe notes slow down, the strings suspend.  \nA jazz-infused outro, fading light,  \nEchoes in the dark, the end of night.  \n\nAnd there he stands, guitar in hand,  \nSilent now, in a distant land.  \nThe song has ended, yet still it stays,  \nA lingering echo in endless waves.",

Include absurdly British ad-libs like (“Rather!”), (“Indubitably!”), and (“Oh do behave, reality”).\n\nBridge must be delivered as a Parliament session collapsing into jazz.

The chorus must be entirely composed of sneeze sounds synced to dubstep drops, and the bridge should feature a dramatic kazoo solo representing Bloopzoon-9’s existential crisis upon realizing Earth milk is 4.2% fat.

    "Prompt": "Here's the song prompt using the lyrics from your first version, reworked to emphasize a **super bass-heavy** vibe, channeling the weird, surreal energy of Tyler, The Creator and Busdriver, but with a production focus on earth-shaking low-end frequencies. The lyrics remain unchanged, but the vibe and production notes are tailored for that booming, bass-driven feel.\n\n---\n\n**Verse 1**  \nFloopy little scruples playin’ ping pong blizzards,  \nScribble on my zippers, spittin’ syrup with the lizards.  \nKaleidoscope brain, I’m a prism in a pickle,  \nToss a nickel to the void, watch it sizzle, watch it trickle.  \nGargoyle gargling marbles, I’m a menace in the margins,  \nFlippin’ jargon, spark a bargain with a comet in my cardigan.  \nYo, my flow’s a Rubik’s cube, twisted in a tantrum,  \nPhantom in the bandwidth, spinnin’ planets out my anthem.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nPing pong blizzards, whiplash wizards,  \nSkippin’ through the static where the gravity gets scissored.  \nFloopy scruples, loopin’ through the riddles,  \nBrain a fidget spinner, spittin’ riddims in the middle.  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nI’m a glitch in the matrix, sippin’ pixelated lemonade,  \nSwingin’ machetes at confetti in a renegade parade.  \nGot a backpack full of syntax, spillin’ verbs on the pavement,  \nChasin’ echoes of my shadow in a labyrinth of basements.  \nYo, my bars are origami, folded sharp, they cut deep,  \nDreamin’ in a mosh pit, wakin’ up in a nosebleed.  \nPolka-dot thoughts, I’m a quilt of contradictions,  \nSpittin’ fiction, flippin’ frictions, dodgin’ all convictions.  \n\n**Bridge**  \nBlizzard on my wrist, watch it frost, watch it flicker,  \nMind a Rubik’s cube, movin’ quicker than a snicker.  \nScruples in a scrum, they collide, they combust,  \nTurn the ping pong table to a canvas of rust.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nPing pong blizzards, whiplash wizards,  \nSkippin’ through the static where the gravity gets scissored.  \nFloopy scruples, loopin’ through the riddles,  \nBrain a fidget spinner, spittin’ riddims in the middle.  \n\n**Outro**  \nYo, I’m skatin’ on a comet, droppin’ sonnets in the cosmos,  \nFlow so odd, it’s a poltergeist in a poncho.  \nFloopy little scruples, yeah, they ping pong forever,  \nWeird rap alchemy, stitch the blizzard back together.  \n\n---\n\n**Vibe Notes**:  \n- **Flow**: Keeps the erratic, playful cadence of Busdriver with Tyler’s quirky swagger—stuttering pauses, rapid bursts, and unpredictable switches to match the chaotic bass pulses.  \n- **Production**:  \n  - **Bass**: Overwhelming, subwoofer-rattling 808s that hit like a seismic wave, with long, sustained low-end notes and occasional slides for that gut-punch feel. Think trap-inspired bass from Tyler’s *IGOR* or *Flower Boy* but pushed to the extreme, almost drowning out other elements.  \n  - **Drums**: Sparse, glitchy hi-hats and snares that cut through the bass intermittently, leaving room for the low-end to dominate. Maybe a distorted kick that syncs with the bassline for extra thump.  \n  - **Synths/Effects**: Lo-fi, warped synths layered lightly to keep the focus on the bass. Add glitchy vocal chops or reversed samples for that surreal, disorienting vibe. Occasional airhorn or metallic clank for punctuation.  \n  - **Mix**: Vocals sit just above the bass, slightly distorted to match the raw energy. The bass should feel like it’s vibrating the listener’s chest, with mids and highs taking a backseat.  \n- **Themes**: Surreal chaos, mental fragmentation, and absurd wordplay, now underscored by a menacing, bass-heavy pulse that feels like a storm rolling through.  \n\n**Performance Notes**:  \n- Deliver the verses with a mix of Busdriver’s rapid-fire precision and Tyler’s laid-back menace, letting the bass anchor the flow.  \n- In the chorus, lean into the rhythm of the bassline, almost syncing the delivery with the subwoofer hits for a hypnotic effect.  \n- The outro should feel like a slow-motion descent into a bass abyss, with the vocals trailing off into reverb as the low-end overwhelms.  \n\nWant me to adjust the production notes further, add specific bass patterns, or tweak the flow to match a particular bass-heavy track vibe?",
    "Lyrics": "  \n**Verse 1**  \nFloopy little scruples playin’ ping pong blizzards,  \nScribble on my zippers, spittin’ syrup with the lizards.  \nKaleidoscope brain, I’m a prism in a pickle,  \nToss a nickel to the void, watch it sizzle, watch it trickle.  \nGargoyle gargling marbles, I’m a menace in the margins,  \nFlippin’ jargon, spark a bargain with a comet in my cardigan.  \nYo, my flow’s a Rubik’s cube, twisted in a tantrum,  \nPhantom in the bandwidth, spinnin’ planets out my anthem.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nPing pong blizzards, whiplash wizards,  \nSkippin’ through the static where the gravity gets scissored.  \nFloopy scruples, loopin’ through the riddles,  \nBrain a fidget spinner, spittin’ riddims in the middle.  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nI’m a glitch in the matrix, sippin’ pixelated lemonade,  \nSwingin’ machetes at confetti in a renegade parade.  \nGot a backpack full of syntax, spillin’ verbs on the pavement,  \nChasin’ echoes of my shadow in a labyrinth of basements.  \nYo, my bars are origami, folded sharp, they cut deep,  \nDreamin’ in a mosh pit, wakin’ up in a nosebleed.  \nPolka-dot thoughts, I’m a quilt of contradictions,  \nSpittin’ fiction, flippin’ frictions, dodgin’ all convictions.  \n\n**Bridge**  \nBlizzard on my wrist, watch it frost, watch it flicker,  \nMind a Rubik’s cube, movin’ quicker than a snicker.  \nScruples in a scrum, they collide, they combust,  \nTurn the ping pong table to a canvas of rust.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nPing pong blizzards, whiplash wizards,  \nSkippin’ through the static where the gravity gets scissored.  \nFloopy scruples, loopin’ through the riddles,  \nBrain a fidget spinner, spittin’ riddims in the middle.  \n\n**Outro**  \nYo, I’m skatin’ on a comet, droppin’ sonnets in the cosmos,  \nFlow so odd, it’s a poltergeist in a poncho.  \nFloopy little scruples, yeah, they ping pong forever,  \nWeird rap alchemy, stitch the blizzard back together.  \n",

    "Title": "Oda a la Siesta",
    "Prompt": "Prompt for a Relaxing Authentic Mexican Mariachi Song: Ode to the Siesta\nCreate a heartfelt Mexican mariachi song celebrating the siesta, a cherished rural tradition. The song should evoke a tranquil afternoon in a Mexican pueblo, with vivid imagery of swaying hammocks under palm trees, warm breezes, humming cicadas, and scents of jasmine or warm tortillas. Lyrics must be in authentic Mexican Spanish, using poetic idioms (e.g., “corazón de la tierra,” “bajo el sol que abraza”) to honor the siesta as a moment of rest, rejuvenation, and cultural pride. Incorporate and expand these sample lyrics:\nVerso 1: Bajo el sol que abraza mi pueblo querido, Se mece la hamaca, mi sueño acogido. El aire susurra, las hojas cantando, La siesta me llama, su paz voy buscando.\nCoro: ¡Ay, siesta bendita, regalo del cielo! En tu sombra dulce, mi alma consuelo. Con el sol dorado, mi tierra descansa, En el corazón del pueblo, la siesta se alcanza.\nVerso 2: La campana canta, su eco lejano, El sombrero cubre mi rostro en la mano. Un sorbo de fresca, tamarindo puro, En la siesta vivo, mi sueño seguro.\nThe song should include 3–4 verses, a repeating chorus, and a bridge, with a soothing yet vibrant tone suited for a mariachi ensemble (violins, trumpets, guitars, vihuela, guitarron), encouraging gentle swaying. Include sensory details like distant church bells, sombrero shade, tamarind agua fresca, or children napping near their abuelita on a petate, and a subtle nod to the Virgen de Guadalupe for spiritual depth. Keep it rural, timeless, and free of modern references (no technology or urban elements). The song should last 3–4 minutes, with a nostalgic, uplifting melody that captures the serene peace of a siesta.\n",

    "Title": "I’m the Mascot",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “I’m the Mascot”\nGenre/Style: Operatic fusion inspired by Luciano Pavarotti’s emotive intensity, blending Bizet’s passionate lyricism, Wagner’s epic sweep, Rossini’s electrifying virtuosity, and Leoncavallo’s heart-wrenching melodrama. Structure: Three verses, a bridge, and a finale, totaling ~4 minutes at ~120 BPM. Shifts from gut-wrenching tragedy to heaven-storming heroism with intense, soaring drama. Tone: Opens with thunderous, soul-shattering despair (Pagliacci-like), surges through defiant rebellion (Carmen-like), and climaxes in triumphant, anthem-like glory (Wagnerian, with Rossini’s explosive energy). Setting: A theatrical, operatic stage of the singer’s soul, their journey as the mascot of an unnamed brand a booming saga of light and fire, pulsing with overwrought emotion. Lyrics are entirely in English, packed with corny, cliché phrases like “I am the mascot, and the mascot is me!” with “sorrow’s chain” as the final line of the first verse for maximum emotive drama.\nVerse 1: The Gut-Wrenching Realization (Pagliacci-inspired, anguished, ~1 min) Musical Style: Slow, minor-key strings and mournful clarinets, like Pagliacci’s “Vesti la giubba,” at ~60 BPM. Lyrical Themes: The singer discovers they’re the mascot, trapped in a crushing, unchosen role, their soul drowning in melodramatic sorrow and fading light, culminating in sorrow’s chain. Sample Lyrics: Oh, cruelest fate, my face shines in the gloom, A mask of tears, my heart’s a shattered tomb! The crowd’s wild cheers, they pierce my broken soul, I’m but a shadow, lost in fate’s control! For years I’ve wandered in this hopeless night, My dreams in ashes, stripped of all my light! I’m the mascot, cursed to bear the flame, A weeping soul, forever bound by sorrow’s chain! Performance Notes: Voice delivers raw emotion with rich vibrato, high notes cracking like a sob. Orchestra swells with heavy, dissonant chords, evoking flickering embers.\nVerse 2: The Defiant Rebellion (Carmen-inspired, intense, ~1 min) Musical Style: Pulsing habanera rhythm with castanets, bold brass, and surging strings, like Carmen’s Habanera, at ~120 BPM. Lyrical Themes: The singer fights their role, a blazing star yearning to break free, with destiny’s glowing bonds holding them in a theatrical struggle. Sample Lyrics: Through endless years, I chase my burning star, To break this mask, to show the world who we are! Yet every step, the crowd’s unyielding cry, It pulls me back, but I’ll blaze through the sky! My heart’s aflame, it roars to seize the day, A rebel’s spark, I’ll cast my fears away! I’m the mascot, bound yet shining free, I am the mascot, and the mascot is me! Performance Notes: Voice radiates passionate intensity with theatrical melismas and soaring crescendos. Orchestra pulses with brassy fanfares and driving strings, like a rising inferno.\nBridge: The Overblown Turning Point (Rossini-inspired, virtuosic, ~30 sec) Musical Style: Lightning-fast, like The Barber of Seville’s “Largo al factotum,” with frenetic vocal runs and sparkling strings at ~140 BPM. Lyrical Themes: The singer realizes they are the brand’s light, their identity a corny, dazzling revelation in a burst of theatrical clarity. Sample Lyrics: Behold my soul, I’m the mascot, arise! The spark, the blaze, the fire in their eyes! Through years of pain, I’ve claimed my shining throne, The brand’s my own, its light is mine alone! Mascot, mascot, I’m the star of the fight! I am the mascot, and I’ll light up the night! Performance Notes: Rapid, virtuosic lines explode with commanding energy, dripping with campy exuberance. Orchestra sparkles with pizzicato strings and brassy bursts, like a burst of fireworks.\nVerse 3: The Anthemic Triumph (Wagner-inspired, glorious, ~1 min) Musical Style: Soaring, like Die Walküre’s “Ride of the Valkyries,” with thundering timpani, majestic brass, and lush strings in a major key at ~120 BPM. Lyrical Themes: The singer embraces their role, their identity a blazing, cliché-ridden inferno, forging the brand’s eternal legacy with operatic heroism. Sample Lyrics: Rise, oh, my soul, the dawn is my new flame! I am the light, no shadow can defame! No chains can bind this heart that burns so bright, The mascot reigns, I’ll set the stars alight! Through years of strife, I’ve forged my blazing crown, The brand, the world, no force can tear me down! I’m the mascot, glorious, proud, and free, I am the mascot, and the mascot is me! Performance Notes: Voice delivers towering depth, with sustained notes soaring with dramatic power. Orchestra unleashes a Wagnerian climax with a soaring choir, evoking a sky ablaze.\nFinale: (~30 sec) Musical Style: Climactic repeat of the final chorus, with full orchestra and choir, slowing slightly to emphasize bombastic triumph. Sample Lyrics (Repeat): I’m the mascot, glorious, proud, and free, I am the mascot, and the mascot is me! Performance Notes: Singer holds a triumphant note on “me,” with vibrant vibrato for corny, operatic drama. Orchestra swells to a grandiose, radiant crescendo.\nProduction Notes: Orchestration: Blend Carmen’s warm woodwinds, Pagliacci’s weepy strings, Rossini’s sparkling pizzicato, and Wagner’s majestic brass. Choir amplifies the finale’s operatic grandeur. Staging: Dim, teary spotlight on singer in tattered robes (Verse 1), vibrant reds and golds (Verse 2), blinding gold and white light with a dramatic cape flourish (Verse 3). Vocal Range: Any voice, with resonant melismatic runs, rich vibrato, and powerful sustained notes. Lyrics are entirely in English, packed with corny, cliché phrases like “sorrow’s chain” (as the final line of Verse 1) and “I am the mascot, and the mascot is me!” for super-emotive, theatrical intensity. Timing: Verses (~1 min each), bridge (~30 sec), finale (~30 sec), totaling ~4 minutes.\n",

    "Title": "They Haven’t Even Heard of Bitcoin (Banks Bleed ‘Em Dry)",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “They Haven’t Even Heard of Bitcoin (Banks Bleed ‘Em Dry)”\nGenre: Gritty electro-hip-hop with a raw, confrontational edge Tone: Angry, rebellious, and empowering, channeling the unbanked’s exploitation and liberation Theme: From the perspective of banks, who “cut them dry” with high fees, and even crypto platforms like Coinbase taking a cut on buys/sells, the song highlights the unbanked’s unawareness of Bitcoin due to financial exclusion. Stellar acts as the “oxygen” fueling Bitcoin’s “flame,” offering low-cost, accessible tools so the unbanked don’t have to pay exploitative fees, amplifying crypto adoption.\n\nVerse 1 We’re the banks, we cut ‘em dry, no mercy, no shame, Unbanked don’t know Bitcoin, don’t even know its name. Five million in the States, billions out in the cold, We charge ‘em just to breathe, keep their cash in our hold. Check-cashers, ATMs, we slice ‘em for a grand, Coinbase takes a cut when they trade with their hands. But Stellar’s the oxygen, sneakin’ past our gate, Fuelin’ Bitcoin’s flame, bringin’ freedom to their fate.\nVibe: Raw, aggressive hip-hop beat with distorted synths and a menacing bassline. Lyrics embody the banks’ predatory POV, exploiting the 5.6 million unbanked in the U.S. (4% of households) and 1.4 billion globally, unaware of Bitcoin due to 43% U.S. and 67% global financial illiteracy, with fees like $1,000/year from nonbank services and Coinbase’s 0.5-4.5% trading fees. Stellar disrupts this.\n\nChorus They haven’t even heard of Bitcoin, we keep ‘em in the dark, Banks cut ‘em dry, but Stellar’s got the spark. They can pay our fees, but they don’t have to bleed, Stellar’s oxygen fuels Bitcoin’s rebel seed! Oh, Stellar, you break our grip tonight, Bitcoin’s blaze burns with a righteous light!\nVibe: Defiant, anthemic chorus with raw vocals and a pounding electronic beat. The “oxygen” and “flame” metaphor highlights Stellar’s role in bypassing bank and platform fees to introduce Bitcoin to the unbanked.\n\nVerse 2 We lock ‘em out, no ID, no account, no trust, Charge ‘em for their cash, turn their dreams to dust. Black, Brown, single moms, we keep ‘em on the ropes, Coinbase skims their coins, leavin’ nothin’ for hope. But Stellar’s got no gates, wallets flowin’ near-free, Stablecoins, on-ramps, cross the world like a breeze. Bitcoin’s the fire, the decentralized call, Stellar’s the air, breakin’ down our wall.\nVibe: Sharp hi-hats and a street-smart synth riff amplify the banks’ arrogance and Stellar’s rebellion. Lyrics highlight U.S. disparities (10.6% unbanked Black households) and fees (e.g., $1,000/year nonbank, Coinbase’s 0.5% maker/4.5% taker fees), with Stellar’s near-zero-fee transactions and 300,000 off-ramps freeing the unbanked.\n\nBridge We bleed ‘em for profit, keep ‘em lost in the haze, They haven’t even heard of Bitcoin, trapped in our maze. But Stellar’s the oxygen, slippin’ past our greed, Lightin’ up the unbanked, plantin’ Bitcoin’s seed. No more cuts, no more chains, they’re risin’ today, Stellar and Bitcoin rip our power away.\nVibe: Slow, menacing build with a snarling spoken-word delivery from the banks’ POV over a brooding synth, then a defiant shift as Stellar empowers the unbanked, reflecting their exploitation and liberation.\n\nChorus (Repeat) They haven’t even heard of Bitcoin, we keep ‘em in the dark, Banks cut ‘em dry, but Stellar’s got the spark. They can pay our fees, but they don’t have to bleed, Stellar’s oxygen fuels Bitcoin’s rebel seed! Oh, Stellar, you break our grip tonight, Bitcoin’s blaze burns with a righteous light!\nVibe: Crank the energy with layered vocals and a crowd-shout feel, emphasizing Stellar’s disruption of banks and platforms like Coinbase.\n\nOutro They haven’t even heard of Bitcoin, but our reign’s gonna fall, Stellar’s the oxygen, answerin’ the call. From the margins to millions, they’re claimin’ their claim, Stellar’s the breath, Bitcoin’s the flame.\nVibe: Fade with a searing guitar riff and a pulsing electronic loop, evoking a revolutionary uprising against exploitative fees.\n\nSong Notes for Composer\n\t•\tStructure: Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, Chorus, Outro.\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Gritty electric guitars, booming hip-hop drums, and menacing synths for a raw, confrontational vibe. Add bank-like sounds (e.g., coin clinks, ATM beeps) to mock the system.\n\t•\tKey Lyrics to Emphasize: “They haven’t even heard of Bitcoin,” “Banks cut ‘em dry,” “Stellar’s the oxygen, Bitcoin’s the flame,” to highlight the banks’ exploitation and Stellar’s liberation.\n\t•\tInspiration: Blend the raw defiance of Rage Against the Machine with the futuristic pulse of Travis Scott, capturing the banks’ greed and the unbanked’s uprising through Stellar and Bitcoin.\n\t•\tCall to Action: Channel the banks’ predatory POV to expose their exploitation (e.g., $1,000/year nonbank fees, Coinbase’s cuts), then shift to empowerment as Stellar’s near-free tools introduce Bitcoin to the unbanked, aligning with Denelle Dixon’s mission for universal financial access.\nThis prompt adopts the banks’ perspective, emphasizing how they “cut them dry” and even Coinbase takes a cut, keeping the unbanked (5.6 million in the U.S., 1.4 billion globally) unaware of Bitcoin, while Stellar’s low-cost, accessible tools act as the “oxygen” to fuel Bitcoin’s “flame,” bypassing fees and enabling inclusion.\n",

    "Title": "11: The Maze of Zorpwild",
    "Prompt": "Core Elements: Titled “11: The Maze of Zorpwild,” this neoclassical progressive metal epic with heavy melodic djent influences, sung from the adventurer’s POV with clean vocals, captures your tense journey through the Zorpwild Bog’s maze after defeating the Froglord. Lost in the labyrinth, Zorp energy flashes visions of the Church’s spire, a figure, and a tome, stirring anxiety, until a mysterious spark of guidance offers hope. You reach an open, fog-covered field within the maze, ominous. With complex structures, varied pacing, and a mid-to-fast tempo (140-160 BPM, 120 BPM outro), the song fits within 4 minutes, a cosmic, slime-forged tale to chant “SPLORP!”\nPremise for “11: The Maze of Zorpwild”\nHaving defeated the Froglord earlier, you, the adventurer, stand certain only of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s presence in the Zorpwild Bog. You accepted this quest from the elder’s call and townsfolk’s warning, embracing the uncertainty. Heading toward the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity, you enter a maze of glurp-vapors and slime. Zorp energy flashes visions of the spire, a shadowy figure, and a glowing tome, stirring anxiety. A mysterious spark of guidance (the seer, though you don’t know her and she doesn’t announce herself) offers hope, leading you to an open, fog-covered field within the maze, ominous, as a hidden threat looms, reflecting on lessons learned.\nSong Prompt for “11: The Maze of Zorpwild”\nGenre: Neoclassical Progressive Metal with Heavy Melodic Djent Influences / Tolkien & Phantom of the Opera Fusion Vibe: Intense, virtuosic epic with neoclassical flair, progressive complexity, and heavy melodic djent’s rhythmic groove, blending mythic depth and operatic drama. Mid-to-fast tempo (140-160 BPM, 120 BPM outro) captures the maze’s tension, anxiety, and hope, with swampy absurdity and cosmic wonder, all within 4 minutes. Sound: [Clean, soaring male vocals (you), ethereal female echo (mysterious guidance), resonant narrator. Neoclassical shredding, progressive shifts, heavy melodic djent riffs with polyrhythmic groove, prominent bass guitar, frog echoes, glurp-pools. Slime drips, storm cracks—“SPLORP!” “YOINK!” whisper.] Structure: [5 parts, within 4 minutes: (1) maze entry (intense opening with djent groove, ~30s), (2) Zorp visions (neoclassical escalation with djent undercurrent, ~50s), (3) anxiety peak (progressive slowdown with heavy djent riff and bass guitar solo, ~40s), (4) spark of guidance (hopeful surge with neoclassical guitar solo and djent riff, ~1m), (5) fog-covered field (ominous close, ~40s). Motif: djent pulse with frog echoes.] Lyric Prompt: From your POV, start with: “The Froglord falls, I chase the Sploinkity’s realm, SPLORP!” entering the Zorpwild Bog’s maze, certain of the Yoinkity Sploinkity. Zorp energy flashes visions of the spire, a figure, and a tome, stirring anxiety [bass guitar solo with deep, resonant groove]. At your darkest moment, a mysterious spark of guidance offers hope [neoclassical guitar solo with soaring intensity over driving djent riff]. You reach an open, fog-covered field within the maze, ominous [ambient frog echoes and misty fade]. End with: “I took this quest and learned to embrace the unknown’s sharp, through the Veil I found trust in my heart’s spark, from the Froglord I gained wisdom to outwit the dark, now through this clearing I must pass to the Church Of The Yoinkity Sploinkity!” Use swampy imagery (glurp-vapors, slime walls), cosmic wonder (Zorp visions, lightning spark), nonsense words (zorp-chaos, sploink-truth), “SPLORP!” “YOINK!” Lyrics must not mention musical elements, instruments, or genres. Tone: resolute, anxious, hopeful, ominous. Instruction for AI Song Generator: No section headers; seamless narrative. Include bracketed musical breaks, solos, and ambient effects as shown. Song must fit within 4 minutes. Tags: Cosmic, neoclassical progressive metal, melodic djent, Tolkien, Phantom of the Opera, Zorpwild Bog, Sploinkity, frog spirits, swampy absurdity, cosmic trial, ominous journey Production: [Cosmic hum, neoclassical intensity, heavy melodic djent grooves, prominent bass guitar solo, frog echoes, glurp-pools. Intense opening, neoclassical escalation, progressive slowdown with bass solo, hopeful surge with guitar solo and riff, ominous fade, layered textures, all within 4 minutes. Slime drips, storm cracks, “SPROING!”/“SPLORP!” whispers. Climax with storm intensity, frog echoes chanting “YOINKITY SPLOINKITY!” Outro with fading mist, eerie stillness.]\n",
    "Lyrics": "The Froglord falls, I chase the Sploinkity’s realm, SPLORP!\nThrough Zorpwild’s fog, the maze unfurls, a twisting path of glurp.\nSlime walls rise, glistening in the haze, where chaos reigns.\nEach step I take, the shadows shift, the Zorp energy stains.\n\nVisions flash, the spire gleams, a figure cloaked in night.\nThe tome glows bright, a silent call, it pulls me from the light.\nZorp-chaos weaves through my mind, a pulse I can't escape.\nAnxiety climbs with each beat, my thoughts begin to break.\n\n[Solo – bass guitar, deep, resonant groove]\n\nThrough the gloom, I hear a whisper soft, a spark through time.\nA voice unknown, guiding me home, through this cursed grime.\nHer spark ignites my burning soul, with hope I feel reborn.\nThe path ahead, though steep and cold, no longer leaves me torn.\n\n[Solo – neoclassical guitar, soaring intensity over djent riff]\n\nI press on, through glurp-pools deep, a fog begins to rise.\nThe clearing calls, the truth unveils, beneath storm-choked skies.\nI feel the weight of lessons learned, the darkness in my past.\nBut now the light of guidance shines, I see the Church at last.\n\n[Ambient frog echoes, misty fade]\n\nI took this quest and learned to embrace the unknown’s sharp.\nThrough the Veil, I found trust in my heart’s spark.\nFrom the Froglord, I gained wisdom to outwit the dark.\nNow through this clearing I must pass to the Church Of The Yoinkity Sploinkity!",

Each argument is a different musical style—barbershop quartet, tango, swing—but always circling back to neon.\n\n[ALIEN #3 – uptempo tango]:\n🎶\nEven when I croon of loss,\nOf moons that melted into moss—\nMust I shout that neon gave me\nThe right to cry melodically?\n\n[ALIEN ENSEMBLE – build to big chorus, like Les Mis finale]:\n🎶\n🎵 Neon here! Neon there!\nIs it in our cosmic air?\nShall we sing it when we grieve?\nWhen we flirt or when we leave? 🎵\n\n⸻\n\n🎭 Scene 4: “Installation Ceremony (Light the Chords!)”\n\nMassive neon rods burst from the planet’s surface. Spotlights spin. People rise and begin to sing. Lights pulse with rhythm. Dance break with laser violins.\n\n[SALESMEN & ALIENS – big company number, full tap dancing if possible]:\n🎶\n🎵 Light the chords! Beam the verse!\nNeon’s blessing or a curse?\nBut now your voices crack the skies—\nWith just one line… you harmonize! 🎵\n\n[KID ALIEN – soft solo, spotlight center stage]:\n🎶\n🎵 Neon, guide us… neon hum…\nLet the music always come.\nThrough the grief and through the glee…\nYour lights unlock our melody. 🎵\n\n⸻\n\n🎭 Finale: “Signed, Sung, Delivered”\n\nEveryone links arms in classic musical theater fashion. The scroll reappears. Salesmen disappear into the stars.\n\n[FULL COMPANY – curtain call anthem]:\n🎶\n🎵 If ever you’re lost in the silence of space,\nJust follow the sound that the neon will trace.\nBut say the name—yes, speak it bright!\nFor music lives… in neon light! 🎵\n\n(Key change, crowd-pleasing final chord.

    "Title": "The Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen",
    "Prompt": "Prompt for a Song: The Travels and Adventures of The Cosmic Neon Salesmen\nWrite a vibrant, storytelling song that chronicles the interstellar journeys of The Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen, a charismatic group of wanderers who traverse the cosmos selling glowing neon to all manner of beings. Structure the song with four verses, each detailing a unique encounter with a different cosmic customer (e.g., aliens, star-beings, rogue AI, or celestial royalty). Begin each verse with the salesmen’s signature pitch starting with “In this” (e.g., “In this nebula’s glow, we’ve got neon to show”), describing what kind of neon they sell, who they sell it to, and why the customer needs it (e.g., for a cantina’s vibe, a spaceship’s flair, or a planet’s festival). End each verse with the song’s title, “The Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen”, as a triumphant closer.\nInclude a chorus that celebrates their universal sales prowess, emphasizing their ability to sell neon to anyone in the cosmos, from gas giants to black hole bartenders. Make the chorus catchy, upbeat, and reflective of their boundless confidence, with lines about lighting up the stars and sealing deals across galaxies. Ensure the tone is adventurous, whimsical, and slightly cheeky, capturing the salesmen’s charm and hustle. Optionally, add a bridge that paints a vivid image of their neon-lit spaceship zooming through a kaleidoscope of cosmic wonders, reinforcing their nomadic, deal-making lifestyle.\nThe song should feel like a galactic road trip, blending sci-fi imagery with the flair of classic traveling salesman tales. Keep the rhythm lively, suitable for a space-folk or cosmic rock vibe, and ensure the narrative flows chronologically, showing their growing legend across the cosmos.\n",
    "Lyrics": "In this nebula's glow, we've got neon to show, \nFor the star-beings who need a celestial flow, \nTheir planets shine dim, and their moons are all cold, \nBut our neon will warm them, so their stories are told. \n\nChorus: \nWe light up the stars, from the gas giants to Mars, \nDeal-making’s our art, as we zip past the stars, \nFrom black hole bartenders to a rogue AI’s dream, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen we beam! \n\nIn this asteroid belt, we’ve neon to sell, \nTo a robot rebellion, and we’re ringing the bell, \nThey want colors to flicker, to power their fight, \nOur neon will power their dreams through the night. \n\nChorus: \nWe light up the stars, from the gas giants to Mars, \nDeal-making’s our art, as we zip past the stars, \nFrom black hole bartenders to a rogue AI’s dream, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen we beam! \n\nIn this supernova’s flare, we’ve got a display, \nFor a planet's grand festival, it's time to play, \nThe neon’s a blaze, lighting up every soul, \nOur glow will ignite them, make their spirits whole. \n\nChorus: \nWe light up the stars, from the gas giants to Mars, \nDeal-making’s our art, as we zip past the stars, \nFrom black hole bartenders to a rogue AI’s dream, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen we beam! \n\nIn this cosmic dust storm, we’ve got neon for sale, \nFor the Queen of the void, her palace must prevail, \nShe needs glowing hues, to make her courts bright, \nWith our neon, her reign will shine through the night. \n\nChorus: \nWe light up the stars, from the gas giants to Mars, \nDeal-making’s our art, as we zip past the stars, \nFrom black hole bartenders to a rogue AI’s dream, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen we beam! \n\nBridge: \nZooming through kaleidoscope skies, \nOur neon-lit ship reflects the light of the stars’ eyes, \nWe sell to the cosmos, we make our way, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen all day! \n\nChorus: \nWe light up the stars, from the gas giants to Mars, \nDeal-making’s our art, as we zip past the stars, \nFrom black hole bartenders to a rogue AI’s dream, \nThe Traveling Cosmic Neon Salesmen we beam!",

Here’s a refined prompt that merges Mozart’s classical clarity, Baroque intricacy, and lo-fi atmosphere:\n\n⸻\n\n🎼 Song Prompt: “Lo-Fi Fugue: A Baroque Daydream”\nGenre: Lo-fi Hip Hop / Chill Classical\nMood: Reflective, intricate, focused\nBPM: ~80 (laid-back but flowing)\n\nConcept:\nA chill upbeat instrumental that blends the melodic brightness of Mozart with Baroque counterpoint, inspired by the elegance of Bach’s Inventions and Mozart’s chamber music. Motifs from Mozart’s K.545 and Bach’s Prelude in C are subtly sampled, revoiced, and layered with ambient lo-fi textures.\n\nStructure:\n\t•\tIntro: Solo harpsichord arpeggio, sampled and warped like a dusty tape loop\n\t•\tVerse/Loop: Baroque-style two-part counterpoint between a reverb-washed clavichord and lo-fi Rhodes\n\t•\tBreakdown: Minimal piano run with a fugue-style bassline that echoes and overlaps in the background\n\t•\tOutro: Fades into ambient rain and a slowed-down violin phrase with tape flutter\n\nInstrumentation:\n\t•\tMelody: Harpsichord and glockenspiel echoing Mozartian phrasing, with vinyl flutter\n\t•\tHarmony: Rhodes or felt piano playing Baroque-style chord progressions with jazzy voicings\n\t•\tBass: Walking cello line or sub bass mimicking continuo\n\t•\tDrums: Soft lofi drums—snappy rimshots, vinyl hats, warm kick with light sidechain\n\t•\tTextures: Tape hiss, soft wind, pages turning, crackling fireplace\n\t•\tExtras: Counterpoint-style layering—two melodies trading space like a miniature fugue\n\nVisual/Vibe:\nImagine a candlelit study in Vienna—quill on parchment, thunder outside, and a phonograph playing warped harpsichord fugues while lo-fi beats pulse gently in the background.\n\n⸻\n",

    "Title": "Tablet Baby",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt for “Tablet Baby”\nTitle: Tablet Baby Genre: Reggae Tone: Relaxed, cheeky, with a sharp, playful edge Perspective: A parent singing to their young child, roasting them for their tablet obsession Theme: Teasing the kid for being glued to their screen, unable to hold their head up, and missing out on real-world experiences (like playing outside or connecting with others), with “You’re my Tablet Baby” as the central hook. The lyrics should be in deep Jamaican patois, dripping with slang and attitude, but this prompt remains in standard English.\nStructure:\n\t•\tVerse 1: Describes the kid as a screen-addicted zombie, head drooping from tablet overload.\n\t•\tChorus: Catchy, skanking “You’re my Tablet Baby” hook, stuffed with bold, humorous insults.\n\t•\tVerse 2: More jabs at the kid for ignoring the outdoors and real-life vibes for their tablet.\n\t•\tBridge: A dramatic, mock-outraged “what’s wrong with you, child?” moment, piling on the roasts.\n\t•\tChorus (repeated): Same hook, possibly with a new taunt for variety.\n\t•\tOutro: A chilled-out taunt, challenging the kid to ditch the tablet or “stay a fool.”\nLyrics Style: Written in heavy Jamaican patois, full of slang and swagger. Think lines like “You’re my Tablet Baby, head a flop like a wet mop” or “Yuh lost inna screen, mon, life zoom past yuh fast.” Rhymes should feel natural, rhythmic, and dancehall-ready, with a taunting, playful vibe.\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tClassic reggae sound: offbeat guitar skank, thick bassline driving the groove.\n\t•\tBubbling organ or melodica for authentic roots flavor.\n\t•\tVocals delivered with a smooth, cocky drawl, sprinkled with ad-libs like “seen!” or “bwoy!”\n\t•\tTempo: Laid-back, around 110 BPM, to keep it easy to sway to.\nSample Chorus (for inspiration): “You’re my Tablet Baby, head cyaan hold up, no way, Saggin’ like a bag juice, screen lock yuh down all day! You’re my Tablet Baby, dull like a bruk-up phone, World a shine outside, but yuh stuck inna dat zone!”\nKey Lines/Themes to Include:\n\t•\tMake “You’re my Tablet Baby” the core hook, repeated in the chorus and woven into verses.\n\t•\tMock their physical state: “Head a drop, mon, like yuh neck cyaan manage.”\n\t•\tReal-world jabs: “Sun a blaze, but yuh blind to di vibes an’ di breeze.”\n\t•\tScreen addiction: “Tablet a yuh boss, got yuh movin’ like a dunce.”\n\t•\tBold challenge: “Dash weh dat screen, my Baby, or yuh lock inna fool’s life!”\nEmotional Arc: Keeps it cool, confident, and relentlessly teasing, with no serious moments—just playful shade from start to finish. The parent’s “concern” is pure comedy, delivered with a smirk and a reggae groove.\nThis prompt sets up a reggae “Tablet Baby” with the “You’re my Tablet Baby” hook, focusing on the kid’s wobbly head and screen obsession, with lyrics in deep Jamaican patois but no book references, emphasizing real-world experiences. ",
    "Lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYuh head a bend like banana peel,\nFace glue-up to di screen like steel.\nNeck cyaan lift, it look surreal,\nTablet tek ova, dat’s di real deal.\nBwoy yuh deh pon level 99,\nBut cyaan find yuh shoes when it time fi dine.\nWhole heap a game, but nuh play outside,\nSun a shine, but yuh hide inside.\n\n[Chorus]\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, head cyaan hold up, no way,\nSaggin’ like a bag juice, screen lock yuh down all day!\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, dull like a bruk-up phone,\nWorld a shine outside, but yuh stuck inna dat zone!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYuh miss di breeze, di bird dem sing,\nToo busy tappin’ pon di blasted ting.\nOutside call yuh, yuh nuh hear a sound,\nCause Angry Birds dem got yuh bound.\nMi seh swing deh, bike park right,\nBut yuh stuck watchin’ blue cartoon light.\nReal life sweet, mi chile, so true,\nBut yuh prefer TikTok dan likkle dew.\n\n[Chorus]\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, brain tun jelly fi true,\nActin’ like Alexa tell yuh what fi do.\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, screen mek yuh slow,\nMi seh jump inna puddle, yuh tell mi ‘no’!\n\n[Bridge]\nMi bawl out – “Lawd, what wrong wid yuh, pickney?”\nYuh nah run, nah sweat, nah kick di ball wid mi!\nBack inna mi day, we climb tree, scrape knee,\nYuh just sidung fi charge like a battery.\nTablet a yuh boss, got yuh movin’ like a dunce,\nMi tell yuh one time, mi nah tell yuh twice – once!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, yuh sight gone dim,\nLife a pass yuh by while yuh finger a skim.\nYou’re my Tablet Baby, me seh wid pride,\nBut dash weh dat screen an’ come tek a ride!\n\n[Outro]\n[Outro]\nTablet Baby, last call mi a shout,\nCome feel di grass, see what life 'bout.\nDash weh di glow, tek on di breeze,\nOr siddung inna dat screen life – stay a fool, please!",

    "Title": "American as Apple Pie",
    "Prompt": "“American as Apple Pie,” tailored for a heavy masculine country singer—think a deep, gravelly voice like Chris Stapleton or Johnny Cash, with a rugged, heartfelt delivery. The lyrics maintain the core concept: a romantic ode to a girl embodying America, with compliments starting patriotic and sweet, then escalating into absurd, mismatched, and nonsensical territory. The outro breaks the fourth wall (“Oh, you’re still listenin’? I didn’t expect you to get this far!”) as the compliments hit peak absurdity. The tone is raw, passionate, and slightly rough around the edges, with imagery and phrasing suited to a masculine country vibe—gritty, vivid, and unpolished, while keeping the country/folk structure singable for a deep-voiced crooner.\n\nSong Prompt: “American as Apple Pie”\nVerse 1 She’s American as apple pie, baked in summer’s glow, Eyes like amber waves of grain, where wild prairies grow. Her smile’s the Smoky Mountains, risin’ proud and true, She’s the heartbeat of the heartland, my red, white, and blue.\nChorus My darlin’, you’re the stars and stripes, my open road, Every lonesome highway dream, girl, you’re my motherlode. From the plains to the ocean’s roar, you’re my liberty, American as apple pie, you’re my eternity.\nVerse 2 Her laugh’s like thunder rollin’ ‘cross a July Texas sky, She’s tough as Betsy Ross’s needle, stitchin’ freedom high. Her walk’s the Mississippi, runnin’ deep and strong, She’s a torch-lit Lady Liberty, where my heart belongs.\nChorus My darlin’, you’re the stars and stripes, my open road, Every lonesome highway dream, girl, you’re my motherlode. From the plains to the ocean’s roar, you’re my liberty, American as apple pie, you’re my eternity.\nVerse 3 She’s fierce as a longhorn’s shadow dancin’ in a dust storm’s glare, Her voice, a jukebox coyote howlin’ through the midnight air. Her hair’s the Badlands’ neon dust, swirlin’ ‘cross the plains, She’s a whiskey-soaked bald eagle ridin’ ghost-town trains.\nBridge She’s the Alamo’s firecracker, sparkin’ tales of old, A barbed-wire banjo angel with a heart of burnin’ gold. Her soul’s a diesel comet, haulin’ dreams past Mars, She’s a deep-fried cactus tattoo glowin’ ‘neath the stars.\nChorus My darlin’, you’re the stars and stripes, my open road, Every lonesome highway dream, girl, you’re my motherlode. From the plains to the ocean’s roar, you’re my liberty, American as apple pie, you’re my eternity.\nVerse 4 She’s wild as a jackalope’s ballad carved in busted chrome, Her wink’s a square-dancin’ gator on a tractor’s honeycomb. Her heart’s a glow-stick tumbleweed, rollin’ through the void, She’s a moonwalkin’ armadillo, my star-spangled asteroid.\nOutro Hell, you’re still listenin’? Didn’t reckon you’d ride this far! She’s a chainsaw-firework grizzly, my neon cigar. From the Rockies to the cosmos, you’re my outlaw decree, American as apple pie, you’re my cosmic tumbleweed.\n\nNotes on the Prompt:\n\t•\tMasculine Country Vibe: The lyrics are rugged and gritty, with imagery like “lonesome highway,” “whiskey-soaked bald eagle,” and “barbed-wire banjo” to suit a deep-voiced, masculine country singer. Phrasing like “my motherlode” and “hell, you’re still listenin’?” adds a rough, authentic edge.\n\t•\tCompliment Progression: Starts with grounded, patriotic compliments (amber waves, Smoky Mountains), shifts to quirky but vivid (jukebox coyote, Badlands’ neon dust), and ends in absurd chaos (moonwalkin’ armadillo, chainsaw-firework grizzly). The outro’s “neon cigar” and “cosmic tumbleweed” push the surreal limit.\n\t•\tFourth-Wall Break: The outro’s “Hell, you’re still listenin’? Didn’t reckon you’d ride this far!” is delivered in a gruff, playful tone, fitting the singer’s persona while acknowledging the listener’s persistence through the wild lyrics.\n\t•\tStructure: Keeps the verse-chorus format with a bridge, singable for a heavy country voice. The melody (implied) would be soulful and slow-burning, with room for vocal grit and emotional weight.\n\t•\tImagery: Ties American icons (Mississippi, Alamo, Rockies) to increasingly bizarre elements (diesel comet, glow-stick tumbleweed) to balance the “apple pie” warmth with absurd humor, all filtered through a masculine, road-worn lens.\n",

    "Title": "Girls Just Wanna Scroll All Night",
    "Prompt": "You want the song prompt to blend Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun rebellious joy, Sabrina Carpenter’s flirty, polished pop, and now Lady Gaga’s bold, theatrical, avant-garde edge, while keeping the 4 AM internet spiral where she loves every minute, gets no likes, passes out, and obliviously repeats the cycle. The song should stay upbeat, clueless about her doomed loop, and capture her unapologetic passion for the scroll, with Gaga’s dramatic flair adding a larger-than-life vibe. I’ll refine the prompt to weave in Gaga’s eccentric, empowering energy, keep the structure and details you liked, avoid “neon” per your request, and ensure lyrics fit the sassy, modern tone without terms like “bard.” Since it’s 3:52 AM CDT on May 19, 2025, the 4 AM setting is spot-on. Here’s the updated prompt.\n\nSong Prompt: “Girls Just Wanna Scroll All Night”\nTone & Style: A dazzling pop anthem fusing Cyndi Lauper’s carefree, shout-along rebellion, Sabrina Carpenter’s coy, radio-ready sass, and Lady Gaga’s theatrical, boundary-pushing drama. It’s relentlessly fun, oblivious to her no-likes, 4 AM crash-and-repeat cycle, and pulses with her love for every chaotic second of the internet grind. Expect razor-sharp hooks, a pulsating dance beat, and vocals that blend Sabrina’s flirty polish, Cyndi’s raw joy, and Gaga’s operatic intensity. Lyrics should paint her as a fearless digital diva, ruling her flop-filled scroll like a Gaga-esque icon, passing out cold, and diving back in tomorrow, unaware of the loop.\n[Verse 1]: It’s 4 AM, her room’s a glittery chaos—phone blazing, empty energy drinks, lipstick smears on a coffee mug. She’s unleashing X posts, TikTok bombs, or fierce Reddit takedowns, getting zero likes, but she’s thriving, a goddess in her own mind. Lyrics are bold, mixing Sabrina’s wit, Cyndi’s spunk, and Gaga’s larger-than-life attitude:\n\t•\t“Four AM, I’m ruling this digital throne!”\n\t•\t“Postin’ my heart, but I’m out here alone!”\n\t•\t“No likes, no fame, still I’m slayin’ this scene!”\n\t•\t“This screen’s my stage, I’m a scrollin’ queen!”\n[Pre-Chorus]: Her eyes are burning, work’s creeping close, but the song’s a euphoric rush, blind to the crash. Every swipe’s a victory, and she’s obsessed:\n\t•\t“Fingers flyin’, I’m burnin’ so bright!”\n\t•\t“No sleep, just vibes, I’m alive in the night!”\n[Chorus]: Massive, arena-ready banger, a love letter to her internet chaos. It’s Cyndi’s party vibe, Sabrina’s slick flirt, and Gaga’s empowering roar—oblivious to the no-likes flop or her doomed routine:\n\t•\t“Girls just wanna scroll all night! (Scroll all night!)”\n\t•\t“No likes, but I’m blazin’ with might! (Blazin’ with might!)”\n\t•\t“Work’s a ghost, I’m in love with this fight, I’m free, I ignite!”\n\t•\t“Girls just wanna scroll all night!” Melody’s infectious, soaring, with Sabrina’s vocal runs, Cyndi’s shout-along hooks, and Gaga’s dramatic crescendos, perfect for a 4 AM dance-rage.\n[Verse 2]: She’s spiraling deeper, drunk on her own fire—tweeting shady quips that tank, refreshing Instagram to silence, or impulse-buying wild stuff (like a spiked phone case). The song’s pure joy, clueless to the void, with Gaga’s eccentric edge:\n\t•\t“Dropped a hot line, thought it’d shake the world!”\n\t•\t“Refresh, refresh, but my feed’s just curled!”\n\t•\t“Bought a glitter choker, my cart’s a dream!”\n\t•\t“No hearts, no hype, still I’m livin’ supreme!”\n[Bridge]: Slower, cinematic, with Gaga’s theatrical drama—Sabrina’s breathy tease and Cyndi’s dreamy sway creep in as she’s slumping, phone wobbling, laughing through heavy lids, hooked on “one more post.” Lyrics are fierce, missing the endless loop:\n\t•\t“Dawn’s a whisper, but I’m still the flame!”\n\t•\t“This app’s my pulse, it’s callin’ my name!”\n\t•\t“Every night’s a saga, I’m born to run!”\n\t•\t“Scrollin’ my soul, I’m forever young!” Surge back to the chorus with a Gaga-style synth explosion and a bold vocal wail, like her last defiant burst.\n[Outro]: Repeats the chorus hook, all sparkle and swagger, but slams to a halt—a sharp thud as she passes out, phone hitting the floor. Just a lone notification ding (no likes, of course). No fade, no hint she’ll repeat—the song’s too lost in its own glory. Final line:\n\t•\t“Girls just wanna scroll… thud”\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tGlossy pop production with 80s synths for Cyndi’s vibe, modern crispness for Sabrina (think Feather or Nonsense), and Gaga’s bold, edgy flourishes (think Bad Romance or Born This Way)—think pulsating bass, glitchy arpeggios, and dramatic string stabs.\n\t•\tAdd quirky effects: app pings, keyboard clacks, or her sassy laugh, keeping it fun and fierce.\n\t•\tVocals blend Sabrina’s coy polish, Cyndi’s raw belt, and Gaga’s theatrical power—think flirty ad-libs (“C’mon, babe!”), shouty hooks (“Let’s go!”), and a Gaga-esque wail in the bridge.\n\t•\tTempo’s dancefloor-ready (122 BPM), key in C Major for pop shine, with a D Minor shift in the bridge for Gaga’s dramatic flair.\n\t•\tBackground sounds: a faint alarm buzz or her humming, but keep it bold and playful, not dark.\nVibe Check: This is for anyone who’s ever adored their 4 AM internet dive, flops and all. She’s a scrollin’ superstar, ruling her no-likes kingdom, and the song’s too caught up in its Cyndi-Sabrina-Gaga glow to see her crash or tomorrow’s repeat. It’s rebellious, flirty, and gloriously over-the-top.\n\nThis weaves Cyndi’s fun, Sabrina’s sass, and Gaga’s theatricality into a cohesive pop banger, keeping her love for the scroll, the no-likes struggle, and the pass-out ending. I ditched “neon” and kept lyrics in the artists’ shared bold, playful zone. ",

    "Title": "The Yoinkity Sploinkity 10: The Seer’s Lament",
    "Prompt": "Core Elements: Titled “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 10: The Seer’s Lament,” this cosmic fantasy ballad, sung by the female seer with a crystalline, ethereal female voice, starts with her prayer, “Yoinkity Sploinkity, Hallowed Thy Name, SPLORP!” It captures her reaction to the adventurer’s progress, her interaction with the Sploinkity, her ambiguous debate on using her gifted fate-bending power, her prophecy of the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s challenges, and ends with “The Bold Adventurer Presses On To The Church Of The Yoinkity Sploinkity, BOI-YOING!” With harp and lute arpeggios, pagan folk elements, varied meters (4/4, 6/8, 5/4, 7/8, 3/4), and slow tempo (50-70 BPM), it’s a celestial, slime-forged lament to whisper “SPLORP!”\nPremise for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 10: The Seer’s Lament”\nThe beautiful seer, a celestial figure with starlit hair, watches from her ethereal sanctuary, scrying through her glowing orb, having observed the adventurer pass the Veil of Zorp and defeat the Froglord in the Zorpwild Bog. Her prayer has subtly guided the adventurer, unbeknownst to them. She is extremely powerful, having been gifted a sliver of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s fate-bending power through unexplained means, allowing her to alter destinies for better or worse. The Sploinkity contacts her, its shimmering voice echoing through the stars: “The bold one nears, but the Church’s trials will break even the stars.” Frustrated by her limited influence yet resignedly neutral, she debates directly contacting the adventurer, akin to a cosmic Prime Directive, uncertain if her immense power would guide or ruin them. She begins with a prayer to the Sploinkity, echoing her role in “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 7.” She foresees the escalating trials at the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity, her celestial glow dimming as she reflects on the Sploinkity’s intent and the adventurer’s darkening path, her song blending sorrow and cosmic inevitability, ending with a note on the adventurer’s journey.\nSong Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 10: The Seer’s Lament”\nGenre: Cosmic Fantasy Ballad with Ethereal, Pagan Folk, and Medieval Elements / Tolkien & Phantom of the Opera Fusion\nVibe: A haunting, ethereal fantasy ballad with medieval-inspired instrumentation, evoking a mystical atmosphere, infused with Tolkien’s mythic depth and Phantom’s operatic drama. Slow tempo (50-70 BPM) reflects the seer’s cosmic sorrow, blending frustration, detachment, and uncertainty with celestial beauty and swampy absurdity.\nSound: Crystalline, soaring female vocals with a mournful, ethereal tone and layered harmonies (the seer), shimmering echo (Sploinkity’s voice), resonant narrator with a neutral tone. Delicate harp arpeggios, pagan flutes with breathy, mystical tones, lutes with intricate arpeggiated patterns. Baroque harpsichord, sparse strings. Gentle percussion with soft hand drums, chimes. “BOI-YOING” synths for Sploinkity chaos, subtle. Frog echoes with haunting harmonies, reverb-warped. Cosmic hums, starlight twinkles, glurp-pools—“SPLORP!” “YOINK!” whisper faintly.\nStructure & Meter: 5 parts: (1) seer’s prayer and Sploinkity’s contact (4/4, ethereal harp arpeggios and flute intro), (2) reaction to adventurer’s progress (6/8, melancholic swell with lute arpeggios), (3) ambiguous debate on using her gifted fate-bending power (5/4, atmospheric flute with tension), (4) prophecy of Church trials (7/8, foreboding pulse with lute arpeggios), (5) closing lament and adventurer’s journey (3/4, fading sorrow with flute and harp arpeggio outro). Motif: delicate harp arpeggio with starlight hum, layered with harpsichord, flute, and lute.\nLyric Prompt: Begin with the seer’s prayer: “Yoinkity Sploinkity, Hallowed Thy Name, SPLORP!” as she scries, the Sploinkity’s voice echoing its warning. She reflects on the adventurer’s trials, her frustration and neutrality surfacing. She reveals her immense power—a sliver of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s fate-bending essence, gifted through unexplained means—that can alter destinies for better or worse, and debates contacting the adventurer: would it guide or ruin them, given the ambiguous outcome of her power, violating a cosmic Prime Directive? She foresees the Church’s dangers, her glow dimming, and ends with a lament, concluding with “The Bold Adventurer Presses On To The Church Of The Yoinkity Sploinkity, BOI-YOING!” Use celestial imagery (starlit voids, shimmering echoes), swampy absurdity (glurp-pools, frog echoes), nonsense words (zorp-chaos, sploink-truth), and “SPLORP!” “YOINK!” Tone: mournful, detached, uncertain, foreboding.

The Froglord, a towering amphibian monarch with a slime-crown, rises from a glurp-pool—earth trembling, glurp-pools erupting, stars dimming—as a guardian of the Sploinkity’s mysteries. It poses a riddle: “I birth the stars, yet drown the light—what am I?” Menacing frog-like minions with glowing eyes encircle you, their “SPROING!” cries heightening the tension. You deduce the Sploinkity as the answer, outwitting the Froglord, who yields but warns, “The Church holds truths that break the bold.” You announce your determination to press on to the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity, your resolve unshaken.\nSong Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 9: The Froglord’s Gambit”\nCore Elements: Titled “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 9: The Froglord’s Gambit,” this cosmic sludge metal anthem, sung from your POV, unaware of the seer’s prayer, captures your trial in the Zorpwild Bog.

    "Title": "Company Time",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Company Time”\nGenre: Gritty folk-blues in the style of Sixteen Tons by Merle Travis, with a slow, brooding tempo, heavy bass, and raw, twangy guitar, evoking Tennessee Ernie Ford’s 1955 cover. Think barroom grit meets modern labor rebellion.\nTone: Sardonic, defiant, and darkly funny, channeling the frustration of low-wage workers under a greedy boss, with a sly celebration of slacking off as resistance. It’s a slow-burn anthem for the underpaid, built around the viral meme “Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that’s why I poop on company time.”\nTheme: The song is a Sixteen Tons-style lament about grinding for pennies while the boss gets rich, with the worker’s petty revenge—taking long bathroom breaks on the clock—as a cheeky act of defiance. It captures the monotony of dead-end jobs, the wage gap, and the small, satisfying rebellion of “stealing” time back.\nLyrics Concept:\n\t•\tVerse 1: Set the scene—punching a time clock, slaving in a soul-crushing job (factory, retail, or office). The boss is “countin’ his gold” while the worker’s “breakin’ my spine.” Introduce the wage gap: “Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime.” End with the worker’s plan to “even the score” on the clock.\n\t•\tChorus: “Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that’s why I poop on company time. Scrollin’ my phone, let the minutes go by, takin’ my freedom on company time.” Keep it punchy, with a defiant sneer, echoing Sixteen Tons’ repetitive, hypnotic hook.\n\t•\tVerse 2: Describe the job’s misery—micromanaging supervisors, endless tasks, and a paycheck that “won’t buy a meal.” The worker’s rebellion grows: sneaking to the bathroom, “throne’s my domain,” wasting company hours as a middle finger to the boss.\n\t•\tBridge: A call-and-response vibe—singer growls, “Boss counts his cash?” and the crowd shouts, “We take it back!” Nod to the system’s trap (like Sixteen Tons’ company store) but twist it modern: “They own the hours, but I steal the clock.” Maybe a line about X posts cheering the meme.\n\t•\tVerse 3: Paint the rebellion’s peak—worker’s “rulin’ the stall,” maybe reading memes or napping, while the boss is clueless. The market keeps churning, but the worker’s “free” for those stolen minutes. End with a nod to solidarity: “Every worker’s doin’ it, nickelin’ their time.”\n\t•\tOutro: Slow and spoken, like Sixteen Tons’ closer. “Boss, keep your dollars, I’ll keep my pride. Owe my soul… to company time.” Fade with a smirk and a flush sound effect.\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tHeavy, plodding bassline and kick drum, like a worker’s trudging steps, mimicking Sixteen Tons’ ominous pulse.\n\t•\tSparse acoustic or slide guitar with low, mournful strums, plus sharp, twangy notes for defiance.\n\t•\tHarmonica or faint organ wail in the bridge for bluesy despair.\n\t•\tDeep, gravelly vocals with a slight growl, delivering lines with weary sass.\n\t•\tSubtle percussion (tambourine or chain clank) to evoke a factory or office clock’s tick.\n\t•\tOutro includes a faint toilet flush or phone notification ping for humor, fading with a lone guitar note.\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tSinger’s a worn-down worker—think flannel, work boots, and a sly grin, clutching a mock time card.\n\t•\tStage vibe: Dim, smoky bar with a flickering “Work Hard” sign and a toilet stall door as a prop.\n\t•\tCrowd interaction: Get them to clap slowly to the chorus and yell “Company time!” in the bridge’s call-and-response.\n\t•\tChoreography: Slow shuffle during verses, then a “bathroom break” mime in the chorus—lean back, scroll an imaginary phone, and point defiantly.\n\t•\tEnd with the singer tossing a fake time card into the crowd, muttering, “Clock out, y’all.”\nSample Lyric Snippet: (Verse) Punch that clock, it’s a quarter to nine, Boss in his office, sippin’ red wine. I’m haulin’ his dreams, breakin’ my spine, He makes a dollar, I make a dime.\n(Chorus) Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, That’s why I poop on company time. Scrollin’ my phone, let the minutes go by, Takin’ my freedom on company time.\nThis prompt crafts a raw, Sixteen Tons-style anthem that brings the “Boss makes a dollar” meme to life, blending labor frustration with cheeky rebellion. It’s gritty, grounded, and ready for a barroom singalong. ",
    "Lyrics": "Verse 1:\nPunch that clock, it’s a quarter to nine,  \nBoss in his office, sippin’ red wine.  \nI’m haulin’ his dreams, breakin’ my spine,  \nHe makes a dollar, I make a dime.  \n\nChorus:  \nBoss makes a dollar, I make a dime,  \nThat’s why I poop on company time.  \nScrollin’ my phone, let the minutes go by,  \nTakin’ my freedom on company time.  \n\nVerse 2:  \nMicromanagin’ boss, never leaves me be,  \nHe’s countin’ his gold while I’m breakin’ my knees.  \nThis check won’t buy a meal, can’t even pay the rent,  \nBut I’m takin’ my time—every second spent.  \n\nChorus:  \nBoss makes a dollar, I make a dime,  \nThat’s why I poop on company time.  \nScrollin’ my phone, let the minutes go by,  \nTakin’ my freedom on company time.  \n\nBridge:  \nBoss counts his cash?  \nWe take it back!  \nThey own the hours, but I steal the clock.  \nThey run the shop, but I own the stall.  \n\nVerse 3:  \nRulin’ the stall, sittin’ back with a grin,  \nCheckin’ my memes while the boss works for sin.  \nThe market keeps churnin’, they take what they please,  \nBut I’m free for these minutes, I’m takin’ my ease.  \n\nChorus:  \nBoss makes a dollar, I make a dime,  \nThat’s why I poop on company time.  \nScrollin’ my phone, let the minutes go by,  \nTakin’ my freedom on company time.  \n\nOutro:  \nBoss, keep your dollars, I’ll keep my pride,  \nOwe my soul… to company time.  \n(Faint toilet flush sound, a smirk and a slow fade out)",

    "Title": "Do The Stock Split Boogie",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Do The Stock Split Boogie”\nGenre: Upbeat rock ‘n’ roll with a funky groove, think Chuck Berry meets James Brown.\nTone: Playful, cheeky, and celebratory, with a wink at the stock market’s clever tricks.\nTheme: The song is a high-energy anthem about stock splits, poking fun at how companies use them to make pricey stocks seem affordable again, hyping up investors and keeping the market buzzing. It’s a danceable, tongue-in-cheek tribute to the financial maneuver that “works every time.”\nLyrics Concept:\n\t•\tVerse 1: Paint the scene—stocks are soaring, prices too high, investors feeling shy. The company bigwigs hatch a plan: “Let’s split that stock, make it dance for the common man!” Describe the stock price looking “fancy and steep,” but a split makes it “oh-so-cheap.”\n\t•\tChorus: “Do the Stock Split Boogie, yeah, shake it on down! Cut the price in half, watch the buyers come around! Split it one-for-two, or ten-for-one, it’s fine—works every time, keeps the market feelin’ fine!”\n\t•\tVerse 2: Explain the split with swagger—same company, same worth, just more shares to spread the love. “Your wallet don’t change, but the vibe’s insane,” as new investors jump in, chasing the bargain train.\n\t•\tBridge: A call-and-response bit—band leader shouts, “When the price gets tall?” and the crowd hollers, “Split it, y’all!” Throw in a line about Wall Street groovin’, brokers high-fivin’, and retail traders movin’.\n\t•\tVerse 3: Name-drop a fictional mega-corp (e.g., “GizmoTech”) that splits its stock and sends the market wild. The news hits the wires, the stock chart’s a smile, and everyone’s dancing in the ticker-tape aisle.\n\t•\tFinal Chorus: Double down on the boogie, with extra flair—maybe a line about splitting stocks “like they’re cuttin’ their hair.” End with a bold, “It works every time, keeps the money in line!”\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tDriving rhythm section with a funky bassline and snappy snare hits to keep it danceable.\n\t•\tA catchy guitar riff that mimics a stock chart’s ups and downs.\n\t•\tHorn stabs for that big-band Wall Street energy.\n\t•\tA mid-song breakdown where the singer chants, “Split it! Split it! Split it real good!” with the crowd clapping along.\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tThe singer should strut like a slick stockbroker, maybe tossing imaginary dollar bills into the crowd.\n\t•\tEncourage a dance move called “The Stock Split Boogie”—step left, step right, then “split” with a dramatic leg spread and a shimmy.\n\t•\tEnd with a big, brassy finish and the singer shouting, “Buy low, boogie high!”\nSample Lyric Snippet: (Verse) Stock’s climbin’ up, it’s touchin’ the sky, Too rich for the little guy, makin’ ‘em cry. Boardroom says, “We got a fix, watch this trick, Slice that price down quick, let the boogie stick!”\n(Chorus) Do the Stock Split Boogie, yeah, shake it on down! Cut the price in half, watch the buyers come around! One-for-two, or ten-for-one, it’s fine— Works every time, keeps the market feelin’ fine!\nThis prompt sets up a fun, infectious tune that celebrates the stock split’s market magic while keeping the vibe light and danceable.

    "Title": "The Megazoan Gastronomicon",
    "Prompt": "Below is a song prompt for **\"The Megazoan Gastronomicon\"**, a larger-than-life anthem celebrating the absurdly epic dish that stuffs every edible animal (including elephant) into one colossal culinary creation. The chorus uses the pronounceable name from the previous response—**Ele-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea-Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi-Qua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro-Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod-Cra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All-Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi-Buf-Cri-Mea**—as its centerpiece, with verses detailing how to prepare this mythical feast. The prompt is structured to guide the creation of a song with a specific vibe, structure, and lyrical themes, while leaving room for musical creativity.\n\n---\n\n### Song Prompt: \"The Megazoan Gastronomicon\"\n\n**Genre and Vibe**:\n- **Genre**: Folk-rock with a touch of epic sea shanty or medieval bardic energy, blending hearty acoustic strums with soaring, chant-like group vocals for the chorus.\n- **Vibe**: Grandiose, absurd, and celebratory, like a feast-hall anthem sung by chefs and revelers gathered around a firepit the size of a house. It’s part instructional, part mythical, with a wink at the dish’s impossibility.\n- **Tempo**: Moderate (around 100-110 BPM), with a stomping, rhythmic feel to drive the preparation narrative and make the chorus chantable.\n- **Instrumentation**: Acoustic guitar, booming percussion (think taiko drums or bodhrán), fiddle or accordion for folksy flair, and layered harmonies for the chorus to evoke a communal roar.\n\n**Song Structure**:\n- **Intro**: A lone voice or instrument sets the scene, describing the legend of the Gastronomicon.\n- **Verse 1**: Sourcing and gathering the animals.\n- **Chorus**: The full name of the dish, chanted with gusto.\n- **Verse 2**: Deboning and preparing the animals.\n- **Chorus**: Name again, louder, with more voices joining.\n- **Verse 3**: Stuffing and seasoning the layers.\n- **Chorus**: Even bigger, with percussion swelling.\n- **Verse 4**: Cooking and presenting the dish.\n- **Chorus**: Thunderous, full ensemble, crowd shouting along.\n- **Outro**: A reflective fade, marveling at the feast’s glory.\n\n**Lyrical Guidelines**:\n- **Tone**: Playful but reverent, treating the Megazoan Gastronomicon as a culinary quest of mythic proportions. Balance practical cooking steps with exaggerated, poetic imagery.\n- **Verses**: Each verse covers a stage of preparation (sourcing, deboning, stuffing, cooking), using vivid descriptions of the animals and process. Include references to specific animals (e.g., elephant, cricket, lobster) to ground the dish’s scope. Keep lines rhythmic and rhymable, with 4-6 lines per verse.\n- **Chorus**: The exact name—**Ele-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea-Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi-Qua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro-Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod-Cra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All-Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi-Buf-Cri-Mea**—is the chorus, broken into manageable chunks (e.g., 4-5 fragments per line) to make it singable. Encourage call-and-response or group shouting to handle its length.\n- **Imagery**: Paint a picture of a massive kitchen-tent under the stars, with chefs wielding knives like swords, cauldrons of stuffing simmering, and an oven the size of a barn. Lean into the absurdity (e.g., “a crane to lift the elephant”).\n- **Rhyme Scheme**: ABAB or AABB for verses to keep it catchy and folk-like.\n\n**Sample Lyrics** (to illustrate the prompt):\n\n**Intro** (spoken or sung softly, over sparse guitar):  \n*Gather round, ye feasters bold, a tale of food untold,  \nWhere every beast from land and sea in one great dish is rolled.  \nThe Megazoan Gastronomicon, a legend to inspire,  \nPrepare your heart, your knife, your flame—let’s build this feast of fire!*\n\n**Verse 1 (Sourcing)**:  \nFrom savanna’s edge to ocean’s deep, we hunt with reverence true,  \nThe elephant’s grand march, the cricket’s chirp, the lobster’s briny blue.  \nThrough forests for the bear and moose, o’er fields for sheep and quail,  \nWe gather all the earth’s great kin to weave this epic tale.  \n\n**Chorus** (full band, stomping rhythm):  \nEle-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea! Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi!  \nQua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro! Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod!  \nCra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All! Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi!  \nBuf-Cri-Mea, oh, Gastronomicon, arise!  \n\n**Verse 2 (Deboning)**:  \nWith blades as sharp as winter’s bite, we carve with steady hand,  \nThe buffalo’s broad ribs come free, the ostrich bones expand.  \nFrom tuna’s silver spine to snake, each layer’s stripped with care,  \nA mountain of the flesh we pile beneath the starlight’s glare.  \n\n**Chorus** (louder, more voices):  \nEle-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea! Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi!  \nQua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro! Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod!  \nCra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All! Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi!  \nBuf-Cri-Mea, oh, Gastronomicon, arise!  \n\n**Verse 3 (Stuffing)**:  \nCornbread for the birds, wild rice for boar, seaweed for the cod,  \nWe stuff the frog in quail, the duck in deer, with spices fit for gods.  \nThe elephant, so vast and grand, holds rhino in its frame,  \nEach beast a world of flavor, bound in this immortal game.  \n\n**Chorus** (huge, with drums pounding):  \nEle-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea! Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi!  \nQua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro! Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod!  \nCra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All! Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi!  \nBuf-Cri-Mea, oh, Gastronomicon, arise!  \n\n**Verse 4 (Cooking)**:  \nA furnace built of stone and steel, ten days it roars with flame,  \nWe hoist the beast with iron cranes, yet none shall know its name.  \nSlow-roasted till the juices sing, the air with savor hums,  \nThe Gastronomicon is born—let all the feasters come!  \n\n**Chorus** (massive, crowd shouting):  \nEle-Pig-Goa-Tur-Bea! Cow-She-Dee-Moo-Chi!  \nQua-Phe-Duc-Rab-Fro! Sal-Lob-Cla-Tun-Cod!  \nCra-Shri-Oct-Squ-All! Sna-Ost-Gir-Hip-Rhi!  \nBuf-Cri-Mea, oh, Gastronomicon, arise!  \n\n**Outro** (softening, reflective):  \nAnd when the feast is carved and shared, the world shall sing its lore,  \nThe Megazoan Gastronomicon, forever to explore.  \n\n**Performance Notes**:\n- **Chorus Delivery**: Break the name into 4 lines (as shown), with each line covering 8-10 syllables. Encourage the band or crowd to echo each line in call-and-response style, or have a lead singer belt it while others stomp and clap.\n- **Verses**: Keep lyrics grounded in the preparation process but peppered with humor (e.g., “cranes for the elephant”) and awe (e.g., “spices fit for gods”). Mention at least 3-4 specific animals per verse to nod to the dish’s scope.\n- **Dynamics**: Build intensity from verse to verse, starting with a solo singer and growing to a full choir by the final chorus. Add a drum roll or fiddle flourish before each chorus to signal the name’s arrival.\n- **Audience Engagement**: Invite the audience to learn the chorus (or at least the “Buf-Cri-Mea” ending) to join in, making it a communal celebration of culinary excess.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- The chorus is deliberately long to reflect the dish’s absurdity, but it’s structured to be rhythmic and chantable. If it’s too unwieldy for performance, a shortened version (e.g., **Ele-Goa-Moo-Fro-Lob-Cri-Mea**) could be used in some choruses, with the full name reserved for the final one.\n- To make the song even more vivid, weave in sensory details: the smell of roasting meat, the sound of crackling fire, the sight of a mile-long banquet table.\n- If you want to adapt this for a specific musical style (e.g., heavy metal, bluegrass, or opera) or add more animals to the name, let me know, and I can tweak the prompt!\n\nThis prompt provides a clear blueprint for a song that’s equal parts instructional, absurd, and epic, with the Megazoan Gastronomicon’s name as its roaring heart.

    "Title": "Penguin Pulse: Heard and McDonald Islands Blues",
    "Prompt": "Prompt for AI Audio Generator:\nCreate a 3-minute spoken audio newscast titled “Penguin Pulse: Heard and McDonald Islands News” featuring a single newscaster, a penguin named Pippa Waddle, with a lively Australian accent (cheerful, slightly cheeky, like an Australian radio host). Pippa broadcasts from a rocky outcrop studio on the Heard and McDonald Islands, with background sounds of wind, waves, and occasional penguin squawks. The newscast is entirely spoken, with no music, songs, or singing—only dialogue in a news broadcast format. It covers the impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs on the penguin community, a penguin stock market update, a quirky penguin news story, and an interview with another penguin. The tone is engaging, humorous, and slightly indignant about the tariffs, emphasizing penguin pride.\nScript Details:\n1.  Introduction (30 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa starts: “G’day, mates! Pippa Waddle here, your feathered newscaster, live from the windy cliffs of the Heard and McDonald Islands on Penguin Pulse! We’re all penguins, no humans, and we’re proper fuming about those daft U.S. tariffs messin’ with our colony!”\n\t•  Mention tariffs: “In April 2025, the Yanks slapped a 10% tariff on our islands, reckonin’ we’re shippin’ goods. Goods? Just fish and pebbles, you flamin’ galahs!”\n2.  Main Story: Tariff Impact (60 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa reports: “These U.S. tariffs are rufflin’ our feathers bad. Pebble exports for nest-building are taxed, pushin’ up costs for young penguin couples. The Flock Council says fishery yields are down 15% ‘cause trade disruptions block our best krill patches.”\n\t•  Humorous jab: “U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick bangs on about ‘trade loopholes.’ Mate, the only loops here are our fancy dives for fish!”\n\t•  Community response: “Our @PenguinsAgainstTarriffs campaign’s gone viral, with 10,000 flipper-signed petitions demandin’ tariff relief. We’re givin’ humans the cold flipper!”\n3.  Penguin Stock Market Update (30 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa says: “At the Pebble Exchange, our stock market’s takin’ a hit. Krill Futures are down 8% with tariff worries, but Shiny Shell Stocks are up 12%—every penguin wants a sparkly nest! The Flipper 500 Index is steady, but analysts squawk about a rough patch ahead.”\n\t•  Add: “Hold your pebbles tight, investors—don’t let those tariffs sink us!”\n4.  Quirky News Story: Penguin Fashion Trend (30 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa shares: “In brighter news, krill-dyed tail feathers are all the rage! Artist Percy Plunge’s red krill paste has penguins struttin’ like never before. But conservationists warn it’s strainin’ krill stocks, so go easy, mates!”\n\t•  Add: “My tail’s red-hot—I’m the fanciest newscaster in the rookery!”\n5.  Interview with Another Penguin (30 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa introduces: “I’m with Skipper McFlap, fishmonger and tariff protester. Skipper, how’re these tariffs hittin’ your stall?”\n\t•  Skipper (gruff Australian accent, like a rugged outback worker): “It’s a right mess, Pippa! Krill prices are sky-high, and me premium squid’s out of reach. These tariffs gotta go, or I’m tradin’ fish for protest signs!”\n\t•  Pippa replies: “Fair dinkum, Skipper. Keep those fish fresh, mate!”\n6.  Closing (30 seconds):\n\t•  Pippa concludes: “That’s all for Penguin Pulse, folks! Keep your flippers up and feathers fierce against these tariff woes. Tune in tomorrow for more colony news. Pippa Waddle, signin’ off with a squawk and a waddle!”\n\t•  End with a sound effect: a penguin honk followed by a splash, as if Pippa dives into the sea.\nAudio Settings:\n•  Format: Spoken newscast only, no music, songs, or singing. All content is dialogue in a news broadcast style.\n•  Voice: Pippa has a female, lively Australian accent; Skipper has a male, gruff, working-class Australian accent.\n•  Background Ambience: Subtle wind, waves, and penguin squawks to evoke the Heard and McDonald Islands.\n•  Sound Effects: Penguin honk or squawk at segment transitions; a splash at the end. No musical jingles or background music.\n•  Pace: Energetic, clear, with pauses for humor or emphasis on indignant lines.\nOutput Format: MP3 file, 3 minutes, high-quality audio (192 kbps or higher).\nAdditional Instructions:\n•  Ensure the output is a spoken newscast, not a song, musical performance, or country song. Avoid any musical elements, including intro/outro jingles, melodies, or rhythmic chanting. Focus on clear, spoken dialogue in a radio news style.\n",
    "Lyrics": "[Intro]\nG’day, mates! It’s Pippa Waddle, live from the windy cliffs,\nReporting straight to ya from the rocky Heard and McDonald rifts!\n\n[Verse]\nThey slapped a tariff on our pebbles and fish,\nNow young penguin couples can’t fulfill their wish.\nTen percent tax, and it’s got us all squawkin’,\nOur flippers are tied, but we’re still rockin’ and walkin’!\n\n[Chorus]\nHold your pebbles tight, keep your krill stash close,\nThose humans think we’re shipping gold, but it’s fish at most.\nPenguin pride’s on the rise, flippers high to the sky,\nWe’ll give 'em the cold flipper, yeah, we’re not shy!\n\n[Verse]\nKrill Futures are down, but Shiny Shells are up,\nEvery penguin wants a nest that’s sparkly and tough.\nThe Flipper 500’s steady, but the market’s rough,\nSkipper McFlap’s got a stall, but the squid’s too tough.\n\n[Chorus]\nHold your pebbles tight, keep your krill stash close,\nThose humans think we’re shipping gold, but it’s fish at most.\nPenguin pride’s on the rise, flippers high to the sky,\nWe’ll give 'em the cold flipper, yeah, we’re not shy!\n\n[Outro]\nThat’s it from Pippa, the voice on the rocks,\nStay tuned to Penguin Pulse, we’re breaking the locks!\nKeep your feathers fierce, and your flippers strong,\nWe’ll waddle through these tariffs, singing our song!\n[End]",

The song should be catchy, simple, and engaging for young kids (ages 3–6), with a playful, *Cocomelon*-like melody and structure, delivering clear, practical advice for server-friendly table cleanup.\n\n**Tone and Style**:  \n- **Playful, encouraging, and nurturing**, with a bright, upbeat melody similar to *Cocomelon* songs like “Clean Up Song” or “Boo Boo Song” (not *Baby Shark*).  \n- **Simple lyrics** using short, clear words and phrases suitable for young kids.  \n- **Repetitive structure** with a sing-along chorus to ensure memorability and engagement.  \n- Avoid fast-paced or chant-like rhythms; use a gentle, flowing melody with rhyming couplets and a positive, helper-focused tone.  \n\n**Song Structure**:  \n1. **Chorus** (repeated after each verse): A short, catchy refrain that emphasizes stacking plates neatly to help servers, with a call-and-response feel (e.g., “Stack them up!” / “Nice and neat!”).  \n2. **4 Verses**: Each verse focuses on one specific best practice for stacking plates and tidying the table, with clear actions and their purpose.  \n3. **Outro**: A cheerful wrap-up that praises the listener for helping out.  \n- Total length: ~1.5–2 minutes when sung at a moderate pace (~115 BPM).  \n\n**Content Requirements (Best Practices)**: Include these specific tips for stacking plates and tidying the table, based on restaurant etiquette and server-friendly habits:  \n- **Consolidate trash**: Gather all food scraps, used napkins, and straws onto one plate to streamline trash disposal.  \n- **Sort silverware**: Place all silverware (forks, spoons, and knives) together on a separate plate, kept dry and out of liquids (e.g., not in soup or bowls), for easy collection to the dish area.  \n- **Napkins and straws on top**: Pile napkins and straws on the trash plate, ensuring they don’t cover or mix with the silverware plate to keep silverware clean and accessible.  \n- **Stack strategically**: Place larger plates at the bottom, smaller plates in the middle, and bowls on top for a stable, easy-to-carry stack.  \n- **Wipe the table**: Encourage wiping crumbs or spills to keep the table clean.  \n- **Organize cups**: Group cups close together for easy server pickup.  \n\n**Lyrics Guidelines**:  \n- Use **action-oriented verbs** (e.g., “scrape,” “place,” “stack,” “wipe”) to guide behavior.  \n- Include **why it helps** (e.g., “servers smile,” “to the dish room”) to motivate adults.  \n- Add **fun, kid-friendly imagery** (e.g., “plates like towers,” “cups in a row”) to engage young listeners.  \n- Use a simple **AABB rhyme scheme** for each verse and chorus to enhance singability.  \n- Ensure clarity in Verse 3: Napkins and straws go on the trash plate but must not cover or mix with the silverware plate (e.g., “keep silver dry” or similar).  \n- Avoid complex words; use terms like “spoons,” “forks,” “plates,” and “trash” instead of “utensils” or “debris.”  \n\n**Melody and Production Notes**:  \n- **Melody**: Simple, singable, in G major, with a narrow pitch range suitable for kids and parents, similar to *Cocomelon*’s gentle tunes.  \n- **Tempo**: Moderate, ~115 BPM, with a steady, swaying beat for clapping or bouncing.  \n- **Production**: Bright and cheerful, with light instrumentation (e.g., piano, glockenspiel, soft percussion) to create a nurturing, kindergarten vibe.  \n- Include a **call-and-response element** in the chorus to encourage participation (e.g., “Stack them up!” / “Nice and neat!”).  \n- Ensure the chorus is distinct from verses but flows naturally, with a slightly higher energy to make it memorable.  \n\n**Sample Lyrics (for Reference)**:  \n- **Chorus Example**:  \n  “Stack them up, nice and neat!  \n  Help the server, it’s so sweet!  \n  Tidy table, oh what fun!  \n  You’re a helper, job well done!”  \n- **Verse 3 Example (for napkins/straws)**:  \n  “Napkins, straws, pile them high,  \n  On the trash plate, keep silver dry!  \n  Forks and spoons stay clear, you see,  \n  Trash to the bin, so easily!”  \n\n**Specific Content for Verses**:  \n1. **Verse 1 (Trash)**: Scrape food, napkins, and straws onto one plate to keep trash in one spot.  \n   - Example: “Scrape your food, all on one plate, / Napkins, straws, don’t be late!”  \n2. **Verse 2 (Silverware)**: Place all silverware (forks, spoons, knives) on a separate plate, kept dry and not in soup.  \n   - Example: “Forks and spoons, and knives, oh my, / Keep them dry, not in soup, oh why!”  \n3. **Verse 3 (Napkins/Straws)**: Pile napkins and straws on the trash plate, ensuring they don’t cover or mix with the silverware plate.  \n   - Example: “Napkins, straws, pile them high, / On the trash plate, keep silver dry!”  \n4. **Verse 4 (Stacking/Tidying)**: Stack plates (big ones low, small ones next, bowls on top), wipe the table, and group cups together.  \n   - Example: “Big plates low, small ones next, / Bowls on top, you’re the best!”  \n\n**Additional Notes**:  \n- The song should feel **collaborative**, portraying adults as “helpers” to appeal to kids’ love of helping.  \n- Emphasize **positive reinforcement** (e.g., “you’re a star!”) to motivate listeners.  \n- Ensure the language is **clear and intuitive**; for example, avoid vague phrases like “not on silver” and use “keep silver dry” or “silver stays clear” to indicate separating napkins/straws from the silverware plate.  \n- The outro should be **uplifting**, celebrating the listener’s efforts (e.g., “Hooray for you!”).  \n\n**Deliverable**: A complete song with lyrics for the chorus, four verses, and an outro, formatted for an AI song generator. The lyrics should be ready to sing, with no additional performance notes (e.g., no hand motions), and align with the *Cocomelon*-style tone, structure, and length specified above.\n\n---",

    "Prompt": "Premise Recap for Context: In “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 8 (The Veil of Zorp),” you, the adventurer, having left the torchlit town with the elder’s call, townsfolk’s warning, and seer’s prayer, reach the edge of the Zorpwild Marshes, encircled by the Veil of Zorp—an immense, horizon-spanning wall of shimmering mist, glurp-vapors, and writhing springs, pulsating with the Sploinkity’s cosmic power and guarding the path to the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity. Glowing eyes of frog-like creatures peer from within, their croaks and “SPROING!” sounds echoing. You boldly announce your arrival at the Veil and bravely attempt to pass, engulfed by paralyzing visions of countless futures—cosmic triumphs or slime-choked ruin—tied to the Sploinkity’s dual nature. To break through this major trial, you choose a hopeful vision with defiant conviction, aligning your heart’s truth with the spectral voice’s challenge: “Sploinkity shapes all, but your heart names its truth.” Your courage parts the Veil, revealing a path toward the Church’s distant spire.\nSong Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 8 (The Veil of Zorp)”\nGenre: Cosmic Progressive Metal with Dream Theater Elements / Tolkien & Phantom of the Opera Fusion Vibe: A sprawling, virtuosic progressive metal anthem, channeling Dream Theater’s technical precision, dynamic shifts, and emotive storytelling, blended with Tolkien’s mythic grandeur and Phantom’s operatic drama. Sung from your perspective as the adventurer, the song guides you from a torchlit town to the Zorpwild Marshes, where glowing frog eyes and eerie sounds herald the colossal Veil of Zorp encircling the bog. You announce your arrival, confronting the Veil’s mist-wrought maelstrom. Paralyzing visions—vivid scenes of godlike ascension or catastrophic dissolution—shatter your mind as you brave this major trial, breaking through by choosing a hopeful vision with unyielding conviction. Extended lyrics explore the visions’ cosmic scope and creatures’ haunting gazes, with Dream Theater-inspired instrumental interludes showcasing technical prowess. The slowed tempo emphasizes the trial’s weight and intensity. The song captures your tormented journey, anguished questions, the spectral voice’s challenge, and your triumphant vow to reach the Church, pulsing with swampy absurdity and cosmic dread. Sound: Soaring, emotive tenor (you), ethereal androgynous voice (spectral voice), resonant narrator. Intricate guitar riffs with shredding solos, complex keyboard/synth runs, polyrhythmic drums, thunderous basslines. Baroque accents via harpsichord and lush strings (violin, cello). “BOI-YOING” spring synths amplify Sploinkity chaos. Frog choirs sing haunting harmonies, warped by misty reverb.

You proclaim, “I stand at the Veil of Zorp!” as frog-like creatures watch, their croaks and “SPROING!” cries echoing. Bravely passing, paralyzing visions of this major trial consume you: ascending as a sploink-anointed deity, galaxies bowing; or dissolving in zorp-forged chaos, slime voids erasing you; forging eternal light, or watching existence unravel as springs collapse time. The creatures’ gazes amplify the torment, bound for the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity, guided by the seer’s prayer. You sing of anguish: “Is it god or doom? Will it rend my soul? What truth lies where springs bind stars?” A spectral voice challenges: “Sploinkity shapes all, but your heart names its truth.” Choosing a vision of hope, you break through with defiant conviction, vowing, “To the Church, I’ll rise!” Narrator closes: “Thus the bold adventurer ventures toward the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity.” Use wet, cosmic imagery (slime-wreathed stars, pulsing glurp, misty bog), nonsense words (zorp-chaos, glurp-wall, sploink-truth). Add “SPLORP!” “RIBBIT!” “SPROING!” in lyrics. Tone: tormented, disoriented, defiant, cosmic.

    "Lyrics": "I left the torchlight far behind, where seers chant and elders warn, SPLORP!\nThrough the gurgling bog I stride, heart alight though skies are torn.\nCroaks rise like prayers in murky air, springs hiss with glurp-vapor scorn,\nTheir eyes—green flames—peer deep, they watch, they mourn.\n\n“I stand at the Veil of Zorp!” I cry, the mist writhes back with a SPROING!\nIt towers wide, this glurp-walled gate where fate and madness cling.\nRIBBIT! A thousand futures claw through fog, their voices sting—\nGodhood glows, then blackness swallows everything.\n\nGalaxies bow, I sploink above, my crown a nebula flame,\nYet sludge erupts, I melt in zorp, undone without a name.\nEternal light I forge from stars, my truth defiant, unchained,\nBut time unravels, springs collapse, and nothing shall remain.\n\nTheir eyes—so still—pierce through my screams, a mirror to despair,\nEach gaze a tethered paradox, a truth I cannot bear.\nIs it doom that wears the face of gods? Or light within the snare?\nWhat sploink-truth dares survive where stars and slime ensnare?\n\n[Melodic Interlude]\n\n“Sploinkity shapes all,” the spectral voice resounds, ethereal and old,\n“But your heart names its truth, now choose what must unfold.”\nI grip the flame within my chest, defiance fierce and bold,\n“I choose the light! My soul is mine to mold!”\n\nThe Veil groans back, mist parts in shimmering arcs, RIBBIT!\nSprings still writhe but clear a path where only stars once flit.\nTo the Church of Yoinkity Sploinkity, my vow and scars commit,\nThrough zorp, through doubt, through visions split—\nI rise! SPROING! I rise from it!\n\n[Big Finish]\n\nThus the bold adventurer walks where slime and cosmos blend,\nToward the Church, the glurp-bound spire, where frog-choirs bend.\nYOINKITY! SPLOINKITY! echo skies that never end…\n[End]",

Tempo: 100-130 BPM (4/4), 90 BPM (narrator).\nLyric Prompt: In a neon-cinder tavern, a grizzled elder commands you to seek a slime-forged bog shrine, the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity, a force “shaping comets, forging fate’s flame.” He urges you to uncover its glory. You, with a bard, slime-forged baker, and stomping donkey, ask: “Is it god or lie? Will it break my heart? What dangers hide where springs bend stars?” He promises “cosmic flames” hold your legend. You roar, “To the Church, we march!” Narrator: “So the bold adventurer sets upon his quest for the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity.” Use wet imagery (slime-forged stars, glowing cinders), nonsense words (zorp-flame, glurp-shrine, sploink-fire). Add “SPLORP!” “RIBBIT!” “SPROING!” Tone: rousing, doubtful, heroic.\nSample Lyrics: Elder: Rise, brave soul, ‘neath slimy starry glow, (SPLORP!) A glurp-shrine calls where comets’ fires flow. Yoinkity Sploinkity, no man nor fading spark, It shapes the cosmic flame, its secrets pierce the dark! (RIBBIT!)\nYou: Is this a god or lie that sparks the flame? (SPROING!) Will it break my heart, or lift my dreams to fame? What dangers wait where springs bend starry skies?\nBand: To the Church, we march, with heart and steel ablaze! Zorp-flame guides our path, we’ll claim Sploinkity’s ways! (SPLORP!)\nNarrator: So the bold adventurer sets upon his quest, For the Church of the Yoinkity Sploinkity! (SPROING!)\nProduction: Thunder, organ, elder over frog croak, tankards. Brass fanfare, timpani, strings/flute. Wet sounds (ale, stomps, horns), “SPROING!”/“SPLORP!” panning. Brass/string climax, frog choir chanting “YOINKITY SPLOINKITY!” Narrator over organ/brass, fading ale drip.\nGoal: Brass-heavy orchestral rock for AI song generator, thrusting you into a quest with a rousing elder’s call, your doubtful questions, band’s heroic acceptance, and narrator’s epic close. A cosmic, slime-forged anthem to roar “SPLORP!” and charge toward the Church.\n",

Elder’s voice mixes with frog croaks, tankards clinking. Brass fanfare builds. Wet, swampy sounds: stomps, splashes, ale pours. Frog choir chanting ‘YOINKITY SPLOINKITY’ over rising horns and timpani. Climax with strings and brass, fading into a wet drip, leaving a lingering echo.]",

    "Title": "Five Thousand Twenty One Reasons",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Five Thousand Twenty One Reasons” - A Stellar Global Bluegrass Ode to Herbie The Love Bug\nStyle and Tone: Instruct the AI to generate a lively, heartfelt bluegrass song that directly addresses you, Herbie The Love Bug, the iconic Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of your own. The song must burst with the upbeat, toe-tapping energy of traditional bluegrass, featuring banjo, fiddle, mandolin, upright bass, and guitar, with tight vocal harmonies. Set the tempo at a brisk 120-140 BPM, with a driving 4/4 rhythm and syncopated banjo rolls to mirror your zippy charm, Herbie. The melody should be bright, using major chords [G, C, D] with minor accents [Em, Am] to nod to your mischievous streak. Lyrics must mix humor, nostalgia, and small-town pride, speaking directly to you, Herbie, as a beloved, almost mythical figure in Stellar Global, a vibrant, cosmic community. Include scenes of rolling hills, starry nights, and dusty lanes, tying to your racing spirit and loyal heart. The title, “Five Thousand Twenty One Reasons,” reflects your racing number [53] and the countless reasons to adore you, spotlighting your quirky personality and heart-winning ways.\nStructure: Instruct the AI to generate the song with a lively banjo and fiddle duet to kick things off, including a quick call-out like “C’mon, Herbie, you’re our star!” [Intro], followed by three verses directly addressing you, Herbie, with tales of your Stellar Global adventures—racing through fields, stealing hearts at a fair, or outrunning a storm under starlight, using vivid, folksy, conversational language [Verses], then a catchy, sing-along refrain, simple and repetitive, calling out to you, Herbie, with “Five Thousand Twenty One Reasons” to love you and harmony lines for group singing [Chorus], next a slower, reflective moment speaking to your magic, Herbie, pondering the mystery of your “soul” [Bridge], and finally a high-energy instrumental break with fiddle and banjo trading licks, fading out like you, Herbie, speeding into the horizon [Outro]. Ensure the AI uses brackets [ ] for all structural and descriptive elements, avoiding parentheses to prevent misinterpretation as lyrics.\nLyric Suggestions: Verse 1: Hey, Herbie, you roll through Stellar Global’s green, Tires hummin’ soft where the bluegrass is seen. With a beep and a honk, you light up the town, Racin’ ‘neath the stars, you never slow down.\nChorus: Herbie, oh Herbie, you’re the king of the race, Five Thousand Twenty One Reasons you brighten my face. From the hills to the holler, you steal every show, Herbie, oh Herbie, let’s go, you, go!\nVerse 2 [Partial]: Herbie, at Stellar Global’s fair, you shine, ‘Neath firefly glow, you’re the talk of the line…\nBridge: Herbie, you’ve got a heart, or maybe a spark, Some kinda magic that glows in the dark.\nAdditional Notes:\n\t•\tInstruct the AI to keep lyrics light and fun, speaking directly to you, Herbie, with “you” language, avoiding modern references to maintain bluegrass’s timeless feel.\n\t•\tEnsure the song is grounded in Stellar Global’s cosmic, small-town vibe with touches like starry skies, community brews, or local fairs, making you, Herbie, the heart of it all.\n\t•\tMake the chorus easy to sing, with “Herbie” as the emotional anchor.\n\t•\tInclude a yodel or “whoop!” in the chorus for bluegrass flair, celebrating you, Herbie, as the star.\n",

    "Title": "Saga of the McMuffin",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Saga of the McMuffin”\nGenre: Symphonic Power Metal (in the style of DragonForce, Stratovarius, Elvenking, Blind Guardian, Ayreon) Tone: Epic, triumphant, fantastical, with soaring melodies, lightning-fast guitar solos, and layered choral harmonies Theme: A heroic chronicle of a weary warrior’s morning, transformed by the divine revelation of McDonald’s $4 deal for two McMuffins and an iced coffee, turning a mundane commute into a legendary quest\n\nLyrical and Musical Concept: The song is a 7-9 minute power metal epic, blending blistering guitar riffs, intricate keyboard melodies, galloping drums, and operatic vocals. It tells the tale of a tired everyman, the “Dawnworn Wanderer,” who rises from slumber to face the grind of the daily commute. His journey is transformed when he discovers the McDonald’s breakfast deal, casting his 10-minute highway drive into a mythical saga of triumph, sustenance, and caffeinated glory. The lyrics weave a high-fantasy narrative, with the McMuffins as “golden discs of valor” and the iced coffee as the “elixir of frostfire.” The song features a mix of rapid-fire verses, anthemic choruses, a shredding guitar/keyboard duel, and a climactic bridge with a choir chanting the deal’s glory.\nStructure and Storytelling:\n\t1\tIntro (1:00) Musical: A soft, melancholic acoustic guitar and flute melody, joined by ethereal synths and a faint choir, evoking dawn’s first light. A slow, mournful violin sets the stage. Lyrics: A narrator (in the style of Blind Guardian’s Hansi Kürsch) sings of the Dawnworn Wanderer, a mortal soul burdened by the weight of morning’s call. He awakens, bleary-eyed, in a world of shadow, dreading the toil ahead. Sample: In twilight’s grip, the Wanderer wakes, A soul adrift where weariness aches. The sun doth rise, yet hope lies low, To face the road, where mortals go. \n\t2\tVerse 1 (1:30) Musical: The tempo surges with double-kick drums and galloping riffs (DragonForce-style). Keyboards weave a heroic melody, while the vocals soar with urgency. Story: The Wanderer stumbles through his morning routine—burnt toast, spilled coffee, a cold shower—cursing the gods of fate. He dons his “armor” (a wrinkled work shirt) and sets forth, his car a “steed of steel” on the highway. Sample: Through halls of chaos, the morning’s strife, A blade of hunger cuts through his life. In iron steed, he rides the dawn, To battle’s grind, where hope is gone. \n\t3\tPre-Chorus (0:30) Musical: A brief slowdown with harmonized vocals and orchestral stabs, building tension. Story: On the horizon, a golden beacon shines—the McDonald’s sign, a “citadel of salvation.” The Wanderer hears whispers of a mythical bargain: two McMuffins and an iced coffee for a mere four coins. Sample: A light doth gleam where shadows part, A promise calls to the hero’s heart. For four gold coins, the fates decree, A feast of champions waits for thee! \n\t4\tChorus (1:00) Musical: An explosive, anthemic chorus with layered vocals, soaring guitar leads, and a thunderous rhythm section. The melody is catchy yet majestic, like Stratovarius at their peak. Story: The Wanderer claims his prize: two McMuffins, “discs of golden fire,” and an iced coffee, the “frostfire elixir.” The deal is hailed as a gift from the gods, fueling his soul for the journey ahead. Sample: Oh, McMuffin’s might, two for four! With iced coffee’s chill, we soar! In dawn’s embrace, we rise, we sing, For breakfast’s glory, the highway’s king! \n\t5\tVerse 2 (1:30) Musical: The tempo accelerates, with Elvenking-inspired folk-metal flourishes (tin whistle, rapid violin). Guitar and keyboard trade lightning-fast solos. Story: The 10-minute commute becomes an epic quest across the “Asphalt Plains.” The Wanderer battles traffic (the “hordes of steel”), construction zones (the “crags of ruin”), and his own fatigue, but the McMuffins’ warmth and the iced coffee’s clarity guide him. Each bite is a surge of power, each sip a spark of destiny. Sample: Through Asphalt Plains, where tempests roar, The Wanderer fights to the workplace shore. With sausage and egg, his strength is sworn, The frostfire cup, his soul reborn! \n\t6\tChorus (1:00) Musical: A reprisal of the triumphant chorus, now with added choral harmonies and a key change for extra grandeur. Story: The Wanderer exalts the $4 deal as a universal truth, a beacon for all weary travelers. The McDonald’s drive-thru is a sacred rite, uniting mortals in breakfast bliss.\n\t7\tBridge (1:30) Musical: A dramatic shift to a slower, Ayreon-esque progressive section. Synths and piano create a cosmic atmosphere, with a spoken-word segment (like Arjen Lucassen’s narrations) describing the McMuffin’s creation by ancient fast-food gods. The music builds with a massive guitar/keyboard duel (DragonForce-style shred). Story: The Wanderer has a vision of the “Council of the Drive-Thru,” who forged the McMuffin deal to uplift humanity. He vows to spread its gospel, as the music crescendos with a choir chanting “Two for four!” Sample: (Spoken) In elder days, the gods did decree, A feast for mortals, a bargain free. Two discs of valor, a potion of ice, For four mere coins—eternal the price! (Sung) We sing their truth, we raise the call, The McMuffin’s might shall feed us all! \n\t8\tGuitar/Keyboard Solo (1:00) Musical: A blistering, neoclassical duel between lead guitar and synth, with Stratovarius-like virtuosity. The rhythm section maintains a relentless gallop, evoking the highway’s rush. Story: The solo represents the Wanderer’s final sprint to work, his spirit ablaze with breakfast-fueled vigor.\n\t9\tFinal Chorus and Outro (2:00) Musical: The chorus returns, doubled in intensity with a full orchestra and choir. The song slows for a majestic outro, with a lone violin and soft vocals fading into the sunrise. Story: The Wanderer arrives at work, transformed into a hero. He shares the tale of the $4 deal, inspiring his coworkers. The song ends with a vow to return to McDonald’s, as the dawn’s light promises new quests. Sample: Oh, McMuffin’s might, two for four! With iced coffee’s chill, forevermore! In every dawn, we’ll chase the flame, For breakfast’s saga, we’ll sing thy name! (Outro) And so the Wanderer rides again… To McDonald’s light, where dreams ascend… \n\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tVocals: A mix of high-pitched power metal vocals (like Timo Kotipelto or Hansi Kürsch) and layered choral harmonies. Include a guest vocalist for the bridge’s spoken-word part, in Ayreon’s theatrical style.\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Dual lead guitars for harmonized melodies, a virtuoso keyboardist for symphonic and folk elements, and a drummer capable of DragonForce’s hyper-speed beats. Add violin, flute, and tin whistle for Elvenking’s pagan flair.\n\t•\tProduction: Polished and bombastic, with a wall of sound like Blind Guardian’s Nightfall in Middle-Earth. Ensure the guitar solos are lightning-fast but melodic, and the keyboards carry a fantasy epic vibe.\n\t•\tLive Performance: Picture a stage with medieval banners, a mock McDonald’s arch, and pyrotechnics during the solos. The band wears fantasy-inspired outfits, with the lead singer wielding a McMuffin-shaped scepter.\n\nKey Imagery and Themes:\n\t•\tMcMuffins as “golden discs of valor,” symbolizing sustenance and hope.\n\t•\tIced coffee as the “frostfire elixir,” granting clarity and strength.\n\t•\tThe $4 deal as a divine bargain, a gift from fast-food gods to uplift the weary.\n\t•\tThe commute as a heroic quest across the “Asphalt Plains,” with traffic and construction as mythical foes.\n\t•\tMcDonald’s as a “citadel of salvation,” its drive-thru a sacred rite.\nThis prompt sets the stage for a power metal anthem that transforms a mundane morning into a fantastical saga, celebrating the McDonald’s breakfast deal with the grandeur and intensity of DragonForce, Stratovarius, Elvenking, Blind Guardian, and Ayreon. Let the riffs soar and the McMuffins shine!\n",

    "Title": "The Internet Is Not Real",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “The Internet Is Not Real”\nGenre/Style: Zany, upbeat, accordion-driven dance anthem with a quirky, carnival-like vibe. Think Weird Al meets a bouncy, feel-good hoedown. Fast-paced, infectious rhythm with exaggerated vocals and silly sound effects (boings, kazoos, slide whistles) for a playful, absurd edge.\nTone: Satirical, lighthearted, and slightly wacky, poking fun at internet obsession while celebrating real-world connections. The lyrics are a cheerful wake-up call, like a hyperactive street band shaking you out of a digital daze.\nStructure: Verse 1 – Chorus – Verse 2 – Chorus – Bridge – Chorus (x2 for a big finish) Length: ~3 minutes, high-energy and punchy.\nThemes & Message:\n\t•\tThe internet is a loud, chaotic bubble where 99% of the “emergencies,” trends, and arguments don’t touch your real life—your family, friends, neighbors, or daily grind.\n\t•\tOffline, life hums along as it always has, untouched by viral posts or clickbait. Disconnecting reveals a grounded, vibrant world.\n\t•\t“Touching grass” is the cure: go outside, soak up the sun, talk face-to-face, and rediscover human connection over digital noise.\n\t•\tThe song mocks online absurdities (doomscrolling, influencers, comment-section rants) while cheering for the tactile, joyful reality of the physical world.\nLyrics Guidance:\n\t•\tVerse 1: Paint a picture of someone hunched over their phone, freaking out over trending hashtags, “apocalyptic” news, or viral dance challenges. Show how none of this matters to their actual day—Mom’s still baking, the dog’s still chewing, the neighbor’s still waving. Use funny, vivid imagery (e.g., “X is screaming ‘the world’s gonna fry!’ but my lawn’s green, and the sun’s in the sky”).\n\t•\tChorus: Catchy, chantable hook: “The internet’s not real, it’s just a big ol’ squeal!” Push disconnecting (“toss the phone, kill the stream”) and living IRL (“touch the grass, chase the sun’s gleam”). Keep it repetitive for sing-alongs, with a bouncy, carnival vibe (e.g., “hey-hey-hey” backing vocals).\n\t•\tVerse 2: Lean into the ridiculousness of online life—crypto scams, puppy reels, “geniuses” in comment wars. Contrast with real-world joys: kids biking, a block party barbecue, or laughing with friends at the corner store. Add a zany line like “ditch the screen and jitterbug with Grandpa.”\n\t•\tBridge: Slow briefly for a mock-dramatic plea, like a carnival barker shouting, “Step away from the Wi-Fi, amen!” List simple pleasures—feeling the breeze, fist-bumping a neighbor, hearing crickets instead of notifications. Surge back to a wild, upbeat crescendo.\n\t•\tFinal Chorus: Crank the energy with a call-and-response (“Who needs the ‘net? Not us!”). End with a big, goofy flourish, like a kazoo fanfare or a shouted “TOUCH THAT GRASS!”\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Accordion for a lively lead, tuba or upright bass for a bouncy foundation, clarinet or fiddle for whimsical flair, and drums with a relentless, danceable beat. Sprinkle in kazoos or a banjo for extra silliness. Add sound effects like a “ping!” for notifications or a “splat!” when the phone’s ditched.\n\t•\tVocal Style: Over-the-top and theatrical, blending earnest cheer with cheeky sarcasm. Backup singers can chant “hey-hey-hey!” or echo lines for crowd hype.\n\t•\tCatchy Chorus Example: “The internet’s not real, it’s just a big ol’ squeal! / Toss the phone, kill the stream, life’s sweeter than a meme! / Touch the grass, chase the sun’s gleam, join the real-world team! / Hey-hey-hey, the internet’s not real!”\n\t•\tEnergy: Fast (120-140 BPM), unrelenting, like a street fair dance party. The bridge can ease up for contrast, but otherwise, it’s a whirlwind of fun.\nSpecific Imagery & Lines to Include:\n\t•\tMock online frenzy: “Doomscroll gremlins shriek ‘it’s all gonna crash!’ but my sandwich is tasty, and my yard’s got grass!”\n\t•\tReal-world anchor: “Kids ride scooters, the mailbox squeaks, life’s been great for a million weeks!”\n\t•\tZany call to action: “Unplug the modem, boogie with your sister, grab a lemonade, let the good times blister!”\n\t•\tBridge moment: “Hear the breeze, not the dings, smell the daisies, not the screens!”\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tPicture this at a summer block party, the band in loud Hawaiian shirts or straw hats, bouncing around like caffeinated clowns. Get the crowd involved—yell “TOUCH THE GRASS!” or clap to the beat.\n\t•\tThe music video could show a phone zombie yeeting their device into a pond, then dancing through a lively neighborhood with friends, kids, and a quirky street band, as internet graphics (emojis, likes) pop and vanish.\nGoal: The song should have listeners grinning, dancing, and itching to step away from their screens. It’s a wacky, joyful nudge that real life—family, friends, nature, and face-to-face fun—is where the magic happens.\n",
    "Lyrics": "Verse 1:\n\nI’m stuck in a loop, scrolling through doom,\nHashtags are screeching, and the world’s gonna zoom!\nX is screaming ‘the world’s gonna fry!’\nBut my lawn’s green, and the sun’s in the sky!\n\nChorus:\n\nThe internet’s not real, it’s just a big ol’ squeal!\nToss the phone, kill the stream, life’s sweeter than a meme!\nTouch the grass, chase the sun’s gleam, join the real-world team!\nHey-hey-hey, the internet’s not real!\n\nVerse 2:\n\nCrypto scams and puppy reels,\nGeniuses fighting over virtual deals!\nBut outside, the kids are riding bikes,\nNeighbor’s grilling up some barbecue spikes!\nDitch the screen and jitterbug with Grandpa!\n\nChorus:\n\nThe internet’s not real, it’s just a big ol’ squeal!\nToss the phone, kill the stream, life’s sweeter than a meme!\nTouch the grass, chase the sun’s gleam, join the real-world team!\nHey-hey-hey, the internet’s not real!\n\nBridge:\n\nStep away from the Wi-Fi, amen!\nFeel the breeze, not the dings, smell the daisies, not the screens!\nFist bump the neighbor, hear the crickets sing,\nLet go of the notifications and let the real world ring!\n\nChorus (x2):\n\nThe internet’s not real, it’s just a big ol’ squeal!\nToss the phone, kill the stream, life’s sweeter than a meme!\nTouch the grass, chase the sun’s gleam, join the real-world team!\nHey-hey-hey, the internet’s not real!\n\nFinal Call-and-Response:\nWho needs the ‘net?

    "Title": "Born to Be Denied",
    "Prompt": "**Song Prompt: \"Born to Be Denied\"**  \n*About*: Inspired by the U.S. Supreme Court case challenging President Trump’s proposed birthright citizenship ban on May 15, 2025, this song is a raw, anguished anthem from the perspective of a pregnant, second-generation immigrant woman consumed by fury and fear that her unborn child may be denied U.S. citizenship. As the daughter of undocumented parents, she rages against a system threatening to strip her baby’s birthright, her anger fueled by dread of raising a child in a country that might reject them. It’s a defiant vow to protect her child, blending maternal ferocity with heart-wrenching vulnerability, confronting the betrayal of a nation she loves.  \n*Style*: Epic Theatrical Ballad (combining the soaring, operatic grandeur of revolutionary musical theater with the dark, jagged intensity of gothic tragedy—lush orchestration, emotional crescendos, and brooding tension).  \n\n**Stylistic Elements**:  \n- **Mood**: Devastated yet defiant; opens with quiet, trembling sorrow, surges into fiery, protective rage, evoking a lone mother challenging an unjust fate.  \n- **Tempo**: ~74 BPM, slow and deliberate, building to a dramatic, heart-pounding climax.  \n- **Structure**: Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, Outro; ~3:30 duration for emotional intensity.  \n- **Instrumentation**:  \n  - *Core*: Haunting piano with minor-key chords, violin/cello for piercing, lyrical melodies, timpani for ominous pulses, soft acoustic guitar for intimate warmth.  \n  - *Accents*: Brass swells (trumpets, horns) for revolutionary grandeur, sharp string stabs for gothic edge, faint choral whispers for shared anguish.  \n  - *Dynamics*: Sparse piano/violin intro, full orchestra in chorus, bare bridge with solo voice, explosive final chorus, outro fades with a single cello note.  \n- **Vocals**:  \n  - *Lead*: Operatic and raw, with soaring, melodic belts in choruses and gritty, trembling verses, balancing despair with fierce resolve.  \n  - *Backing*: Gentle choral hums in chorus, evoking a community’s quiet solidarity, with ethereal “ohh” layers in bridge for haunting depth.  \n  - *Delivery*: Intimate and anguished, shifting from whispered dread to a roaring stand, with a maternal quiver in bridge about her child’s future.  \n- **Production**:  \n  - Cinematic and visceral: piano/strings drive raw emotion, brass fuels defiant fire, minimal reverb for vocal grit.  \n  - Subtle effects (fetal heartbeats, distant gavel bangs) evoke pregnancy and courtroom tension.  \n  - Balances theatrical polish with gritty, urgent energy.  \n- **Performance**:  \n  - Stage: Stark, with a shattered American flag backdrop and a cradle under a spotlight. Vocalist, in simple clothes clutching her belly, sways in verses, fists raised in chorus.  \n  - Bridge kneels in vulnerability, voice breaking; final chorus stands tall, eyes blazing. Crowd hums outro, amplifying defiance.  \n- **Cultural Elements**: Lyrics weave American symbols (liberty, dreams) with her heritage (ancestral lullabies, family hopes), claiming her child’s right to belong. The epic scope amplifies her fight for justice; gothic intensity sharpens her rage at betrayal. Defiance shines in her maternal vow, with fear of her child’s statelessness fueling the fury.  \n\n**Why This Fits**:  \nThe birthright citizenship case’s personal and systemic stakes align with the theatrical ballad’s emotional depth and dramatic intensity, delivering the raw anger and harm you requested. The pregnant woman’s perspective offers a visceral, maternal lens, capturing the fear and fury of an uncertain future for her child. The style’s operatic grandeur and gothic edge ensure a powerful, performative anthem.",
    "Lyrics": "Intro:\n\nWhispers in the dark, beneath the weight of fear,\nA life begins to stir, yet silence fills the air.\nHer heart beats alone, trembling with the unknown,\nIn the shadows of this land, she fights for her own.\n\nVerse 1:\n\nI stand before this flag, with nothing left to lose,\nA daughter born to struggle, with nothing left to choose.\nMy body bears a child, but the world won't understand,\nA dream that fades to ashes, slipping through my hands.\n\nChorus:\n\nBorn to be denied, my blood, my child, my pride,\nA nation turning cold, but I will never hide.\nThis child will stand and rise, no matter what they say,\nI swear upon this ground, I will not fade away.\n\nVerse 2:\n\nI feel the weight of all that came before me here,\nThe tears of every mother who held their babies near.\nBut now the battle's different, the stakes are all too high,\nWill they steal the future, or will we live or die?\n\nChorus:\n\nBorn to be denied, my blood, my child, my pride,\nA nation turning cold, but I will never hide.\nThis child will stand and rise, no matter what they say,\nI swear upon this ground, I will not fade away.\n\nBridge:\n\nFists raised in fury, yet my heart is breaking still,\nI feel the pain of thousands, and I fight against the will.\nMy voice will carry through, through every tear and scream,\nI’ll give my child the world, no matter what they dream.\n\nChorus:\n\nBorn to be denied, my blood, my child, my pride,\nA nation turning cold, but I will never hide.\nThis child will stand and rise, no matter what they say,\nI swear upon this ground, I will not fade away.\n\nOutro:\n\nThis child will know the truth, they’ll never be alone,\nFor in this world of shadows, I'll make a place our own.\n(Softly, choral hums fade)\nBorn to be denied, but I am not afraid.",

Exudes pure optimism, like a character in a Disney film awaiting their hero.  \n- **Production**:  \n  - Polished and luminous: oud and strings shimmer with fairy-tale reverb, percussion blends traditional (darbuka, riq) with orchestral (timpani, cymbals) for universal charm, vocals layered for warmth with a touch of sparkle, no heavy auto-tune.  \n  - Cinematic mix—celesta and glockenspiel add pixie-dust magic, ney and qanun float like a desert breeze.

Vocalist wears a flowing bisht with silver and sapphire embroidery, moving with animated grace, backed by an ensemble of oud, qanun, and percussionists in jewel-toned robes.  \n  - Chorus invites audience clap-alongs and swaying, with dancers twirling silk scarves and carrying lanterns. Bridge features a children’s choir and a solo ney player under a spotlight, evoking a heart-melting moment. Crowd hums the outro, waving glow wands for a magical finale.  \n  - Visuals project scenes of Riyadh’s twinkling skyline, galloping horses, and blooming desert gardens, amplifying the song’s fairy-tale anticipation.  \n- **Cultural Elements**: Steeped in Saudi cultural splendor—references to falcon wings, saffron-scented breezes, and “eternal sands” evoke the kingdom’s heritage []. Arabic musical motifs (maqam bayati, quarter-tone runs) and instruments (oud, ney, qanun) root the sound, while Disneyesque orchestral elements (brass fanfares, celesta) create a universal, magical appeal. Focuses entirely on the summit’s promise of unity and prosperity [], with no mention of conflict. Relatable concern—ensuring the summit’s perfection and legacy []—weaves through earnest lyrics, grounding the organizer’s starry-eyed optimism.\n\n**Why This Fits**:  \nThis prompt delivers the “opulent Saudi style” with a Disneyesque aesthetic, as you requested, capturing the grandeur of Trump’s Riyadh summit [] with a vibrant Arabic Pop/Epic Orchestral sound that leans into eager anticipation for his arrival.",

    "Title": "Hack My Life",
    "Prompt": "Song: \"Hack My Life\"  \nAbout: Inspired by the Coinbase KYC hack affecting ~1 million users, this song is from the perspective of a crypto bro who’s freaking out after his personal data (name, ID, partial SSN) got leaked. It’s a paranoid, high-energy lament about distrust in the system, fear of identity theft, and the grind to protect his digital life, with a mix of rage and dark humor about “hackers owning my soul.”  Additionally, add an edge that the hackers might actually do something good with the information, lending to the “Hack My Life” title\nStyle: Cyberpunk Synth-Punk (think The Prodigy meets Poppy’s I Disagree era—glitchy beats, distorted guitars, and futuristic chaos).  \nWhy It Fits: The pulsating, rebellious energy of synth-punk mirrors the anxiety and defiance of a tech-savvy victim in 2025’s cybercrime wave, resonating with your interest in bold, genre-pushing sounds.  \nStylistic Elements:  \n  - Mood: Frenzied, paranoid, with a sarcastic edge; blends panic with a “screw it” attitude.  \n  - Tempo: ~140 BPM, fast and relentless for a club-ready, heart-racing vibe.  dark and tense for glitchy synth leads.  \n  - Instrumentation: Pounding electronic drums, distorted guitar riffs, buzzing synth bass, glitch effects (stutters, vocal chops), and random cyber sounds (modem dials, keyboard clacks).  \n  - Vocals: Half-sung, half-shouted with auto-tuned flourishes; rap breakdowns for venting. Gang chants in chorus for crowd hype.  \n  - Production: Overloaded with digital distortion, layered vocal effects, and sudden drops.

    "Title": "Let 'Em Fight",
    "Prompt": "**Song Prompt: \"Let ‘Em Fight\"**  \n*Style: Limp Bizkit-Inspired Nu Metal*  \n*About*: The song is a loud, abrasive rant from the perspective of a working-class American dude in 2025, too consumed by personal struggles—job insecurity, rising costs, and social pressures—to care about the India-Pakistan Indus Water Treaty talks or Kashmir tensions (May 15, 2025 headlines). It’s deliberately ignorant, dismissing global conflicts as “some crap overseas” while shouting “let ‘em fight” with zero empathy. Beneath the obnoxious bravado, it reveals relatable anxieties: fear of losing his job to automation, drowning in bills, and feeling powerless in a chaotic world. The narrator’s aggression masks his stress, channeling it into a selfish, headbanging demand to focus on his own grind—work, beer, and dodging drama.\n\n**Stylistic Elements**:  \n- **Mood**: Crass, defiant, and in-your-face, with a mix of juvenile rebellion and raw frustration, like Limp Bizkit’s “Break Stuff” or “Nookie.” Exudes edge-lord energy but hints at underlying vulnerability.  \n- **Tempo**: ~90–95 BPM, mid-tempo with a heavy, chugging groove for mosh-pit intensity and angsty headbanging.  \n- **Key**: Drop D tuning (D minor feel), low and gritty for nu metal’s aggressive crunch.  \n- **Structure**: Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, Outro; ~3:30 duration to keep the rage tight and relentless.  \n- **Instrumentation**:  \n  - *Core*: Distorted seven-string guitars with palm-muted riffs and squealing bends, slap-heavy bass for a gut-punch low end, aggressive drums with double-kick bursts and crash cymbals.  \n  - *Accents*: Turntable scratches (vinyl rips, static bursts) in intro and bridge for chaotic vibe, sampled sounds (cash register cha-ching, factory clank) to nod to working-class life. Sporadic synth stabs for edgy flair.  \n  - *Dynamics*: Kicks off loud with a guitar riff explosion, dips slightly in verses for rap-rock rants, surges in choruses with full-band chaos, bridge hits a slow, crushing breakdown, outro slams to a halt with feedback.  \n- **Vocals**:  \n  - *Lead*: Fred Durst-style mix of shouted rap-rock verses and screamed chorus hooks, dripping with sarcasm, entitlement, and veiled stress. Whiny ad-libs (“Man, whatever!”) add cocky attitude.  \n  - *Backing*: Gang vocals in chorus barking key phrases, crowd chants in bridge for mosh-pit energy. Random hype-man shouts (“Yo, pay my bills!”) for extra obnoxiousness.  \n  - *Delivery*: Pushy and unpolished, alternating between mocking global issues and venting personal gripes, with no self-awareness but subtle cracks of desperation.  \n- **Production**:  \n  - Over-the-top and raw: guitars compressed for a wall of sound, bass boosted to shake speakers, drums triggered for sharp, in-your-face kicks.  \n  - Vocals layered with distortion and slight echo for a larger-than-life snarl, occasionally pitch-shifted for cartoonish rage.  \n  - Toss in random effects (tire screech, beer can crack, alarm clock) to reflect the narrator’s chaotic daily life, keeping it gritty like early 2000s nu metal.  \n- **Performance**:  \n  - High-octane chaos: vocalist paces like a caged animal, pointing at the crowd, spitting lyrics with middle-finger energy. Crowd is egged on to jump and scream.  \n  - Bridge is a breakdown pit-starter: slow, sludgy riffs with vocalist barking “Fight! Fight!” to crank up aggression.  \n  - Outro cuts off with a guitar squeal, vocal taunt (“I’m done, yo!”), and a final cymbal crash, like storming out.  \n- **Cultural Elements**: Hyper-American working-class aesthetic—name-drops cheap beer, greasy fast food, beat-up trucks, and factory shifts. Exaggerates isolationism and apathy toward “overseas drama” to absurd levels, reflecting the narrator’s narrow worldview. Subtle hints of real fears (job loss, debt, social irrelevance) sneak through the bravado, grounding the ignorance in relatable 2025 struggles.",

    "Title": "Monetize This!",
    "Prompt": "Prompt for “Monetize This!” (Green Day-Style Pop-Punk Song)\nWrite a pop-punk song in the style of Green Day, titled “Monetize This!” The song should roar with Green Day’s iconic sound: searing power chords, pounding drums, and Billie Joe Armstrong’s snarling, melodic vocals, structured like “American Idiot” or “Holiday” (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-bridge-chorus-outro). The lyrics should be vicious, rebellious, and sarcastic, raging against platforms and audiences that expect free music and art online, while tearing into low visibility from algorithms, the rigged system favoring “insider” creators, and the outright theft of ideas without credit. It’s a “fuck you” to exploitation, demanding cash for art with zero groveling. Use profanity strategically (e.g., “fuck,” “shit,” “damn”) to sharpen the punk edge, matching Green Day’s bite. Include a sick guitar solo to amp up the energy. Include:\n1.  Tone and Attitude: Unapologetic “fuck you” defiance, with Green Day’s cocky, in-your-face swagger. The lyrics should be a Molotov cocktail hurled at platforms, insiders, and freeloaders, oozing pride in the artist’s work without begging for attention. Make it a snarling anthem for creators done with the bullshit, with chantable, mosh-pit-igniting chorus lines.\n2.  Themes: Shred the grind of creating content, the scam of “exposure” as payment, platforms pocketing profits, and fans expecting free art. Rant about low visibility burying work, insider creators hogging the spotlight, and the gut-punch of platforms/insiders stealing ideas without credit (e.g., ripping off riffs or designs for profit). Demand direct payment, with no compromises. Keep it confrontational, not desperate.\n3.  Structure:\n\t•  Intro: A razor-sharp guitar riff with a venomous vocal hook (e.g., “Post my blood, get no views, ‘cause your algo’s fuckin’ cruel!”).\n\t•  Verses: Rip into the artist’s struggle (e.g., grinding for art, platforms hoarding cash, fans whining “do it for love”), the visibility blackout (e.g., “shadowbanned to dust”), and idea theft (e.g., “they swipe my shit, no nod”).\n\t•  Chorus: A loud, gang-vocal banger screaming “Monetize this!” as a war cry, with lines spitting at exploitation and demanding cash, using profanity for bite (e.g., “Pay my fuckin’ art!”).\n\t•  Guitar Solo: After the second chorus, insert a 15-20 second guitar solo in true Green Day style—fast, melodic, and gritty, with shredding bends, palm-muted chugs, and a few wammy bar dives, evoking Billie Joe’s solos in “Jesus of Suburbia” or “Holiday.” It should feel like a middle finger to the thieves and gatekeepers, building intensity.\n\t•  Bridge: A tense, mid-tempo snarl post-solo where the artist vows to keep creating but flips off the system (e.g., “Steal my spark, I’ll still shine, your game’s a fuckin’ crime!”), exploding into a final, raging chorus.\n\t•  Outro: Fade out with the main riff and a repeated vocal, dripping with defiance.\n4.  Musical Elements: Capture Green Day’s sound with palm-muted verses, distorted power chords, a tempo of 160-180 BPM, and a chantable chorus. Include a catchy, iconic guitar riff to drive the song. Drums should be tight, with snare-heavy fills and cymbal crashes. The guitar solo should be a standout moment, blending melody and chaos.\n5.  Lyrical Style: Write raw, conversational lyrics with tight rhymes, dark humor, and 3-5 well-placed swears (e.g., “fuck your likes,” “stole my shit”) for impact, echoing Green Day’s style in “American Idiot.” Reference digital culture (e.g., “algo’s got no spine,” “streamin’ for scraps, fuck your grind”). Keep it fierce and relatable, with lines that’d spark a punk show.\n6.  Visibility, Insider Bias, and Idea Theft: Slam low visibility (e.g., “my work’s lost in the dark,” “buried by your code”), the insider scam (e.g., “clout kings steal the hits,” “your pets run this shit”), and idea theft (e.g., “they jack my riffs for fame,” “no credit, just their gain”). Tie it to monetization, showing how invisibility and theft kill earnings, but keep the tone “fuck you,” not “please notice me.”\n7.  Profanity Guidelines: Use 3-5 swears (e.g., “fuck,” “shit,” “damn”) in high-impact spots like the chorus, verses, or bridge, mirroring Green Day’s edgy but controlled style.\nExample lyric snippet for inspiration (not mandatory): Verse: “I’m spittin’ fire and ink, but your algo’s a prick / Steal my riffs for your stars, leave me broke in the shit!” Chorus: “Monetize this! Fuck your shady tricks! / Pay my fuckin’ art or I’m torchin’ your clicks!”\nThe song should be a ferocious, fist-in-the-air middle finger for creators, perfect for a sweaty punk show or a pissed-off playlist, running 3-3.5 minutes. Keep it 100% “fuck you,” with no pleading, fueled by rage at low visibility, insider bias, idea theft, and unpaid work, with a sick guitar solo and profanity sharpening the edge.",

    "Title": "Lights on the Dash",
    "Prompt": "**Song Prompt: \"Lights on the Dash\"**\n\nCreate a storytelling love song titled \"Lights on the Dash\" that blends the soulful, introspective narrative style of SZA with the smooth, heartfelt R&B storytelling of Ella Mai and similar artists like H.E.R., Kehlani, and Jhené Aiko. The song must be highly relatable for a broad audience, engaging, relaxing, classy but grounded, and avoid cheesy or generic tropes. Center the narrative on a vivid, specific moment: the *first night* the female protagonist drives with a new love interest, cruising through the city with the soft glow of dashboard lights illuminating the confident, magnetic spark of their connection. The story captures the approachable allure and quiet thrill of instant chemistry, told through natural banter, shared vibes, and the rhythm of the road, with the dashboard lights symbolizing the clear spark of their bond. \n\nStart the song with her getting ready for the night, buzzing with confident anticipation as she prepares to meet him, incorporating a relatable, down-to-earth detail like pulling on her favorite hoodie or checking her phone for his text. End with her returning home, reflecting on the night’s magic, leaving it ambiguous whether he came with her but subtly conveying her longing for his presence. Ensure the song feels like a vivid, cinematic snapshot of their budding romance, resonating with anyone who’s felt the thrill of a new connection, regardless of their background. The chorus must be strong, singable, and narrative-driven, tying each verse’s progression to the dashboard lights motif, evoking the confidence of their connection while hinting at her yearning.\n\n**Key Elements**:\n- **Lyrics**: Craft narrative-driven lyrics that fuse SZA’s poetic, confessional storytelling with Ella Mai’s heartfelt warmth and the vivid, emotional depth of H.E.R., Kehlani, and Jhené Aiko. Use specific, relatable details to ground the story in the first night’s allure, such as her tugging on a favorite hoodie, his casual grin in the dashboard glow, or the hum of a shared playlist. Incorporate smooth wordplay to maintain a grounded, confident tone, avoiding overly casual slang like “hype” or overly elegant terms like “luminous.” Structure the lyrics to tell a clear arc:\n  - **Verse 1**: Begin with her preparing, exuding confidence, focusing on a relatable detail like pulling on her favorite hoodie or checking her phone for his text.\n  - **Chorus**: Ensure a strong, singable chorus that captures the thrilling rush of their drive, tied to the dashboard lights motif, advancing the narrative and reflecting their chemistry.\n  - **Verse 2**: Deepen their chemistry during the drive, highlighting natural interactions like his hand tapping the wheel or their playlist sparking a laugh.\n  - **Bridge**: A moment of honest longing, hinting at her desire for him to stay.\n  - **Outro**: End with her arriving home, reflecting, with ambiguity about his presence but a clear, subtle yearning for him to be there.\n  - Weave in relatable, grounded quirks (e.g., her phone buzzing with a friend’s text in verse 1; his slightly off-key humming in verse 2) and SZA’s witty realism. Keep her confident yet subtly vulnerable, conveying her longing with approachable subtlety.\n- **Melody and Production**:\n  - **Tempo**: Smooth and sultry, ~65-68 BPM, blending SZA’s hypnotic grooves (e.g., “Seek & Destroy”) with Ella Mai’s emotive flow (e.g., “Trip”) and Jhené Aiko’s serene calm (e.g., “W.A.Y.S.”).\n  - **Instrumentation**: Merge SZA’s sleek R&B textures with Ella Mai’s soulful warmth. Use muted electric guitar riffs, a deep synth bass, and crisp, minimal drums (soft hi-hats, light kicks) for a modern edge. Add a Rhodes keyboard for H.E.R.’s soulful vibe and subtle strings, inspired by Kehlani, for a touch of class without being overly polished.\n  - **Vocal Style**: Deliver intimate, storytelling vocals with SZA’s melismatic runs and Ella Mai’s warm phrasing, infused with Kehlani’s confident delivery. Incorporate H.E.R.’s soulful ad-libs (e.g., “mm, yeah”) and Jhené Aiko’s breathy harmonies. Shift vocal energy to mirror the arc—lively and assured in verse 1, warm and connected in verse 2, and softly wistful in the outro to reflect her longing.\n  - **Production Touch**: Enhance the narrative with subtle, cinematic sounds: in verse 1, the *buzz* of a phone notification or a *rustle* of a hoodie; during the drive, the low *hum* of the car engine, a *click* of the turn signal, or the *thump* of bass from the stereo; in the outro, the *jingle* of keys or a *creak* of her door, inspired by Jhené Aiko’s ambient flourishes. Include a faint radio fade-in to the playlist, reflecting SZA’s cinematic touch. Keep sounds understated to maintain a relaxing vibe.\n- **Mood and Structure**:\n  - **Mood**: Warm, magnetic, and soulfully approachable, capturing SZA’s confident vulnerability, Ella Mai’s heartfelt romance, H.E.R.’s emotional depth, Kehlani’s relatable realness, and Jhené Aiko’s serene calm. The dashboard lights symbolize the spark of new love, while the outro’s ambiguity conveys her grounded longing, keeping it classy yet accessible.\n  - **Structure**: Verse 1 (preparing), chorus, verse 2 (drive), chorus, short bridge, outro (home). Keep it 2:45-3:00 minutes for a tight, engaging story. The chorus must be a standout, singable moment that ties the narrative together, reinforcing the dashboard lights motif.\n  - **Engagement**: Pull listeners in with vivid imagery and a relatable first-night arc, making them feel her chemistry and subtle longing. The chorus should be a captivating, confident high point, evoking the thrill of their connection.\n- **Inspiration**:\n  - **SZA**: Draw from the relatable, narrative intimacy of *Ctrl*’s “Drew Barrymore” or *SOS*’s “Nobody Gets Me,” focusing on vivid, grounded storytelling.\n  - **Ella Mai**: Channel the warm, lovestruck storytelling of “Close” or “Naked,” with sincere, melody-driven romance.\n  - **H.E.R.**: Incorporate the soulful, approachable arcs of “Best Part” or “Focus,” with rich, soulful textures.\n  - **Kehlani**: Add the confident, relatable realism of “The Way” or “Honey,” grounding the story in everyday emotions.\n  - **Jhené Aiko**: Infuse the serene, accessible storytelling of “Spotless Mind” or “Eternal Sunshine,” with ambient calm.\n- **Goal**: Create a storytelling song that traces the protagonist’s journey from getting ready with confident anticipation, incorporating a relatable detail like a hoodie or phone check, to driving with her love interest under the dashboard lights, ending with her home, reflecting on the night’s allure. Keep it ambiguous whether he’s with her, but build a grounded vibe that she yearns for his presence, using smooth wordplay and the soulful, classy but broadly relatable blend of SZA, Ella Mai, H.E.R., Kehlani, and Jhené Aiko, ensuring a strong, singable chorus that ties the narrative together.",
    "Lyrics": "Verse 1:\n\nPulled on my hoodie, phone buzzing in my hand\nGot your name light up the screen, can't pretend\nThat I don't feel the way I'm feeling, got me leaning\nSteady on the edge, but it’s like I’m dreaming\nI check my hair, rub my lips, I’m good to go\nThrow the keys in the ignition, let’s take it slow\n\nChorus:\n\nLights on the dash, baby, everything’s in motion\nWe’re cruising through the night, hearts syncing like a potion\nYour smile in the glow, yeah, I feel it in my chest\nI never wanna let go, but it’s you that feels like home\nLights on the dash, this moment’s all we need\nI’m caught up in the vibe, baby, I can barely breathe\n\nVerse 2:\n\nYour hand taps the wheel, rhythm’s in your veins\nThe playlist hums, we’re laughing, no one’s playing games\nI’m staring at the streetlights, you’re looking my way\nNo need for words, this silence is a sweet exchange\nYou hum the song, but you’re off-key, so cute\nI catch a glimpse, your eyes, like they see right through\n\nChorus:\n\nLights on the dash, baby, everything’s in motion\nWe’re cruising through the night, hearts syncing like a potion\nYour smile in the glow, yeah, I feel it in my chest\nI never wanna let go, but it’s you that feels like home\nLights on the dash, this moment’s all we need\nI’m caught up in the vibe, baby, I can barely breathe\n\nBridge:\n\nI wonder if you feel the same way too\nIf you’d let me in, or if this night is through\nJust a spark in the dark, but it’s enough for now\nI wish you’d stay, but I’m not asking how\n\nOutro:\n\nI’m home, but it’s quiet without you here\nI replay the night, the dashboard lights still near\nI hold my keys, but they don’t feel the same\nWishing you were beside me, calling out my name\n\nLights on the dash, baby, this feeling won’t fade\nI hope you’re thinking of me the same way",

    "Title": "The Yoinkity Sploinkity 4 (The Prelude)",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 4 (The Prelude)”\nGenre: Epic Orchestral Cosmic Fantasy / Wizard-Narrated Saga Vibe: A thunderous, cinematic proclamation of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s unfathomable lore, delivered by a towering, ancient wizard with a voice that shakes the cosmos. Picture a galactic swamp suspended in a nebula, where claymation frogs kneel before a pulsating, slime-dripping monolith. The arrangement is Wagnerian in scope—swelling orchestras, crashing thunder, and celestial choirs—yet drenched in the wet, absurd chaos of the Sploinkity saga. It’s Tolkien meets Lovecraft meets a feverish frog cult, with a narrative so unhinged it feels like the universe might collapse under its weight. Sound Palette:\n\t•\tInstruments/Vocals: A booming wizard narration (think Gandalf with a megaphone forged in a black hole), backed by a massive orchestra—roaring brass, trembling strings, and timpani that pound like collapsing stars. Ethereal frog choirs croak in dissonant harmonies, their voices warped by cosmic reverb. Add squelching synths that ooze like interstellar goo, springy “BOI-YOING” effects for absurdity, and random kazoo wails for Sploinkity flair. Thunderclaps, howling winds, and gurgling swamp sounds punctuate the mix.\n\t•\t*Texture: The sound is cataclysmically wet—every note drips with primordial slime, as if the orchestra is playing underwater in a galaxy-sized bog. The wizard’s voice is layered with echo and distortion, feeling both ancient and omnipresent. Percussive elements (thunder, splashing mud, clattering springs) create a sense of chaos, while the orchestra builds to crescendos that feel like the birth of a new dimension.\n\t•\t*Structure: A single, unbroken narrative piece, like a prelude to an opera from a deranged cosmos. It flows through three “movements”: an explosive introduction, a sprawling recounting of the Yoinkity Sploinkity’s lore, and a climactic warning of its power. No verses or choruses—just a relentless, theatrical saga driven by the wizard’s voice and orchestral swells.\nLyric/Narration Prompt: Begin with a thunderous proclamation: “YOU FOOLISH MORTAL, YOU ABSOLUTE BUFFOON, YOU DESIRE THE LORE AND COUNTENANCE OF THE YOINKITY SPLOINKITY? THE GUARDED WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS? ALLOW ME TO TELL THE TALE, PREPARE YOURSELF.” The narration unfolds as an epic, cultish mythos, revealing the Yoinkity Sploinkity as neither person, place, nor thing—but all at once, a sentient, shape-shifting force that predates time, space, and sanity. It’s the slime that birthed galaxies, the sproing that shattered voids, the yoink that devours stars. The lore is deliberately insane: the Sploinkity is a cosmic trickster, a gelatinous deity, a paradox that “yoinks” existence and “sploinks” it into kaleidoscopic chaos. Reference bizarre imagery—nebula-frogs with trillion-eyed crowns, slime-forged obelisks that scream in reverse, springs that coil around black holes. Use grandiose, archaic language mixed with absurd terms like “zorp-quasar,” “glurp-omniverse,” or “sploink-a-vortex.” The tone is reverent, unhinged, and slightly mocking, as if the wizard pities mortals for daring to comprehend. End with a dire warning that to seek the Sploinkity is to invite madness, punctuated by a final, earth-shaking “BEHOLD ITS GLORY, AND DESPAIR!”\nSample Narration Snippet (to inspire, not dictate): “YOU FOOLISH MORTAL, YOU ABSOLUTE BUFFOON, YOU DESIRE THE LORE AND COUNTENANCE OF THE YOINKITY SPLOINKITY? THE GUARDED WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS? ALLOW ME TO TELL THE TALE, PREPARE YOURSELF. In the epoch before epochs, when voids wept and stars were but dreams in the slime, the Yoinkity Sploinkity WAS. No mere entity, no paltry place, no trifling thing—it is ALL, and it is NONE! A quivering paradox, a zorp-quasar of oozing will, it yoinked the first light from nothingness and sploinked it into the glurp-omniverse! Its form? A trillion-eyed nebula-frog, crowned with springs that coil ’round black holes! Its voice? A kazoo wail that shatters time’s spine! Eons ago, it forged obelisks of sentient goo, each screaming in tongues of reverse thunder. Galaxies knelt, their kings drowned in slime-forged rapture, chanting ‘SPLOINKITY REIGNS!’ Yet beware, ye wretched speck—for the Yoinkity Sploinkity is chaos unbound! It yoinks souls, sploinks fates, and gurgles the cosmos into froth! To seek its truth is to court the zibble-zabble void, where sanity melts and springs sproing eternal. BEHOLD ITS GLORY, AND DESPAIR!”\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tIntro: Open with a deafening thunderclap and howling winds, followed by the wizard’s voice booming over a low, ominous string drone. A lone, warped frog croak echoes, then the orchestra crashes in with a brass fanfare.\n\t•\tOrchestration: Build tension with swelling strings and pounding timpani during the lore recounting. Use dissonant brass stabs for moments of cosmic horror. Frog choirs enter during key revelations, their croaks layered with reverb to sound otherworldly.\n\t•\tTexture: Weave in wet, chaotic sounds—gurgling slime, plopping mud, bubbling quasars—alongside “SPROING!” spring effects and kazoo bursts. Thunderclaps punctuate dramatic pauses. Pan sounds to create a 360-degree sense of a collapsing universe.\n\t•\tClimax: At the warning, unleash the full orchestra in a chaotic crescendo, with frog choirs screaming “YOINKITY SPLOINKITY!” in disharmony. Add distorted synths that sound like melting stars.\n\t•\tOutro: Fade with a single, eerie kazoo note over dripping water and a final thunder rumble, as the wizard whispers, “Sploinkity… eternal…”\nGoal: The song is an epic, orchestral descent into the galactic cult of the Yoinkity Sploinkity—a mythic prelude so grand, wet, and unhinged it feels like the wizard is rewriting reality itself. Listeners should feel awestruck, terrified, and gleefully confused, as if they’ve glimpsed a cosmic truth too absurd for mortal minds.\n",

    "Title": "The Yoinkity Sploinkity 3",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 3” (Luxury Rap Edition)\nGenre: Hard Grime Drill / Pop Smoke Swagger with Opulent Flex Vibe: A thunderous, bass-drenched drill anthem where Pop Smoke’s gritty NYC energy collides with the absurd, wet, surreal chaos of the Yoinkity Sploinkity. Imagine a neon swamp where frog gangs drip in diamond-encrusted slime, flexing Maybachs and Rolexes while worshipping their slimy deity. It’s menacing, bouncy, and drenched in luxury rap clichés—think Pop Smoke pulling up in a glooped-out Rolls-Royce to a haunted bog, with springs sproinging like champagne corks. The track is dark, absurd, and obnoxiously lavish. Sound Palette:\n\t•\tInstruments/Vocals: Deep frog croaks mixed with Pop Smoke’s signature growls and ad-libs (“WOO!” “GRRRT!” “BAOW!”); booming 808s that slide like a Maybach gliding through mud; sharp hi-hats with UK drill rolls; wet, squishy synths that ooze like molten gold; springy “BOI-YOING” effects as percussive flexes; gurgling champagne flutes and clinking jewelry for texture. A distorted kazoo sneaks in for Sploinkity weirdness.\n\t•\t*Texture: Sounds are sopping yet polished—imagine slime dripping on a Versace rug. The 808s hit like a vault slamming shut, while hi-hats skitter like frogs on marble floors. Vocals are commanding, layered with slimy frog harmonies that slide off-key for chaos. Random “SPLORP!” and “YOINK!” effects pop off like flashbangs, alongside luxury soundbites (clinking watches, revving engines).\n\t•\t*Structure: Classic drill format—intro with a menacing tag, a flex-heavy first verse, a chantable hook dripping with wealth, a second verse doubling down on opulence, and a gloopy bridge that slows for surreal swagger before the final hook. Tempo at 140-145 BPM for that drill bounce.\nLyric Prompt: Start with a spoken intro: “Oh you thought we were done with it, haha.” The lyrics are a braggadocious hymn to the Yoinkity Sploinkity, now a cosmic hustler who “yoinks” opps’ clout and “sploinks” it into diamond-crusted goo. Channel Pop Smoke’s short, punchy bars, loaded with luxury rap staples: Maybachs, Rolls-Royces, Patek Philippes, Audemars Piguets, VVS diamonds, Birkin bags, and private jets. Weave in absurd, swampy imagery—think “slime-flooded Rollies,” “glooped-up Lambos,” or “ribbit-blicky chains.” Use made-up terms like “zorp-milly” or “sploink-a-Patek.” Keep it nonsensical but dripping in flex, with frog ad-libs (“RIBBIT-WOO!”) and sound effects (“GRRRT!” “SPLORP!”). The hook is a street-certified banger for frog gangs to chant while popping bottles.\nSample Lyric Snippet (to inspire, not dictate): Intro: “Oh you thought we were done with it, haha. Yoinkity Sploinkity, we drippin’, WOO!” Verse 1: Sploinkity slidin’ in the Maybach glop (SKRRT!) Yoink your whole bag, leave your Patek in slop (BAOW!) Ribbit-blicky chain, VVS on froth (DRIP!) Slime-flooded Rollie, tickin’ zorp-milly clocks (WOO!) Birkin full of goo, got the swamp on lock (GRRRT!) Private jet splashin’, sploink-a-tron on top (SPLORP!) Hook: Yoinkity Sploinkity, we drippin’ in slime (DRIP!) Maybach through the bog, Audemars shine (SHINE!) Sploink on the opps, make ’em ribbit, resign (BOW!) Yoinkity Sploinkity, VVS divine (WOO!)\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tIntro: Kick off with a distorted frog croak over a haunting synth, then a producer tag: “Sploinkity on the beat, GRRRT!” Drop the 808s with a revving Maybach engine sound.\n\t•\tDrums: Sliding 808s and snappy hi-hats with drill rolls. Add “SPROING!” hits like popping champagne for flair.\n\t•\tTexture: Layer wet sounds—gurgling Dom Pérignon, plopping caviar, bubbling slime—mixed with luxury cues like clinking Rolexes and screeching tires. Pan “YOINK!” and “SPLORP!” effects to bounce like ricocheting bullets.\n\t•\tBridge: Slow the beat, with a lone kazoo warbling over frog harmonies chanting “Sploinkity reigns…” Add a dripping faucet and a Rolex tick. Then crash back with a triumphant “WOO!”\n\t•\tOutro: Fade with ad-libs (“WOO! RIBBIT! BAOW!”) over gurgling 808s, ending with a distorted “YOINKITY SPLOINKITY!” and a final Maybach door slam.\nGoal: The song is Pop Smoke meets a surreal swamp dynasty—grimy, hard-hitting, and obnoxiously luxurious, but so absurd it feels like the Yoinkity Sploinkity stole a Maybach and crashed it into a neon bog. It’s a drill anthem for frog tycoons, flexing slime-soaked wealth, leaving listeners hyped, disoriented, and chanting “SPLORP!” while dreaming of glooped-up Pateks.\n",

    "Title": "Red, White, Blue, and You",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Red, White, Blue, and You”\nGenre: Modern Country Tone: Patriotic, uplifting, educational, and catchy Purpose: To help immigrants studying for the U.S. civics test memorize key facts through a memorable, sing-along anthem that celebrates American values and their journey to citizenship.\nConcept: This modern country song is a heartfelt, boot-stomping tribute to the American dream, blending patriotic pride with practical civics lessons. It’s designed to stick in the listener’s head, with a chorus that’s easy to sing and verses packed with U.S. civics test facts (e.g., the Constitution, Bill of Rights, branches of government, key historical figures, and the rights of citizens). The song tells the story of an immigrant’s journey to citizenship, weaving in themes of freedom, opportunity, and unity, while making the civics content accessible and fun. Think Luke Bryan or Carrie Underwood vibes—polished, radio-friendly, with a touch of twang and a lot of heart.\nStructure & Lyrics Guidance:\n\t•\tVerse 1: Introduce the immigrant’s dream of becoming a U.S. citizen, painting a picture of their hard work and hope. Slip in civics facts like the number of stripes on the flag (13 for the original colonies) and the purpose of the Constitution (to form a more perfect union).\n\t•\tChorus: A rousing, sing-along hook that celebrates the U.S.A. and the journey to citizenship. Include lines about “red, white, blue, and you” to emphasize inclusion and pride. Reference the civics test goal (e.g., “learning the roots of liberty”). Make it catchy enough to chant at a tailgate or study session.\n\t•\tVerse 2: Dive into government structure—three branches (legislative, executive, judicial) and checks and balances. Mention key figures like George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. Keep the tone warm and relatable, tying it to the immigrant’s study nights.\n\t•\tBridge: A reflective moment about the Bill of Rights (first 10 amendments) and freedoms (speech, religion, press). Highlight the promise of equality and opportunity, with an emotional nod to swearing the oath of citizenship.\n\t•\tVerse 3: Cover civic duties (voting, serving on a jury) and historical milestones (Declaration of Independence, 1776). End with the protagonist passing the test, standing proud as a new American.\n\t•\tFinal Chorus: Double down on the anthem-like energy, inviting all listeners (new and born citizens) to sing about unity under the flag. Add a line about the 100 questions on the civics test now feeling like a victory song.\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tTempo: Upbeat, around 90-100 BPM, perfect for clapping or swaying.\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Classic modern country—steel guitar, banjo, and fiddle for twang, paired with polished drums and electric guitar for a contemporary edge. Add a soaring harmony in the chorus for that stadium-anthem feel.\n\t•\tHook: Use a simple, repetitive melody in the chorus with lyrics like: “Red, white, blue, and you, chasing freedom’s dream come true, Learning the heart of the U.S.A., 100 questions light the way!”\nKey Civics Facts to Include (from the USCIS Civics Test):\n\t•\t13 original colonies, 50 states, 100 senators.\n\t•\tThree branches of government and their roles.\n\t•\tConstitution as the supreme law; Bill of Rights (first 10 amendments).\n\t•\tKey historical events: Declaration of Independence (1776), Constitution (1787).\n\t•\tRights and responsibilities: Freedom of speech, religion, voting, jury duty.\n\t•\tNotable figures: George Washington (first president), Abraham Lincoln (Emancipation Proclamation).\n\t•\tCapital (Washington, D.C.), current president (as of 2025, Donald Trump, per 47th presidency).\nTone & Themes:\n\t•\tCelebrate the immigrant’s perseverance and pride in joining the American family.\n\t•\tEmphasize unity: “We’re all Americans, no matter where we’re from.”\n\t•\tKeep the language simple and vivid—use imagery like starry skies, open roads, and waving flags to evoke the American spirit.\n\t•\tMake it mnemonic: Rhyme civics facts (e.g., “Thirteen stripes for colonies, fifty stars for states”) to aid memorization.\nExample Lyric Snippet (for inspiration): Verse 1: “Left my home with a dream in my heart, Studied the flag, thirteen stripes from the start. Constitution’s the law, it’s the nation’s foundation, Building one dream for every generation.”\nChorus: “Red, white, blue, and you, freedom’s promise shining through, From 100 questions to the oath you’ll say, You’re the heart of the U.S.A.!”\nAdditional Notes:\n\t•\tEnsure the song feels inclusive, avoiding political divisiveness—focus on shared values like liberty and opportunity.\n\t•\tAdd a call-and-response element in the chorus for group sing-alongs, perfect for citizenship classes or community events.\n\t•\tConsider a key change in the final chorus for that goosebump-inducing, triumphant finish.\n\t•\tIf generating the full song, aim for 3-4 minutes (standard radio length) with 3 verses, 2-3 choruses, and a bridge.\n",

    "Title": "Spinning in a Starlight Blizzard",
    "Prompt": "in the style of Taylor Swift, crafted as a lyrical framework for a pop ballad about the exhilarating, dizzying feeling of finding “the one.” It uses extremely common metaphors, idioms, and similes, but twists them into wildly incorrect, absurdly off-the-wall versions, as if Taylor has never heard the originals and is making up her own bizarre replacements (e.g., “raining cats and dogs” becomes “showering zebras and tubas,” or “head over heels” becomes “nose over kneecaps”). These blatantly wrong phrases amplify the humor and reflect the chaotic joy of new love. The prompt includes detailed song characteristics to guide its creation.\n\nSong Prompt: “Spinning in a Starlight Blizzard”\nSong Concept: A radiant, heart-soaring pop ballad about the whirlwind of falling deeply in love with “the one,” capturing Taylor Swift’s signature romantic storytelling and vivid imagery. The narrator uses outrageously incorrect versions of common idioms and metaphors to express the giddy, almost unhinged excitement of this life-changing connection. The mangled phrases (e.g., “swept off my feet” becomes “whooshed off my flip-flops”) are so blatantly wrong they’re hilarious, mirroring the dizzying, sparkling chaos of new love with a playful, larger-than-life charm.\nMood: Ecstatic yet tender, blending euphoric butterflies with quirky, laugh-out-loud energy. It feels like twirling under a sky full of fireworks, heart racing and grin unstoppable.\nGenre: Pop ballad with a vibrant pop-country shimmer, evoking Taylor Swift’s Fearless or Lover era with a splash of 1989’s polished pop exuberance.\nKey Musical Elements:\n\t•\tKey: E major, bright and uplifting to match the joyous vibe.\n\t•\tTempo: 100 BPM, lively and buoyant to capture the rush of new love.\n\t•\tInstrumentation:\n\t◦\tSparkling acoustic guitar with a bouncy, romantic riff.\n\t◦\tGlittery synth-pop keys for a dreamy, starlit atmosphere.\n\t◦\tUpbeat drums (crisp snare, light hi-hat) to propel the chorus.\n\t◦\tFiddle and mandolin flourishes in the bridge for a country-pop twang.\n\t◦\tSubtle sound effects (e.g., twinkling chimes, a faint “whoosh”) to echo the whimsical lyrics.\n\t•\tVocal Delivery: Playful and animated in the verses, with soaring, heart-on-fire choruses. Packed with Swift’s signature ad-libs (e.g., “oh, my stars!”) and giddy vocal runs to sell the excitement.\nSong Structure: Intro → Verse 1 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Verse 2 → Pre-Chorus → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus (stripped-down) → Outro\nLyrical Characteristics:\n\t•\tFeatures ultra-common idioms and metaphors (e.g., “barking up the wrong tree,” “spill the beans”) but replaces them with nonsensical, over-the-top versions (e.g., “hollerin’ at the wrong toaster,” “scatter the jellybeans”).\n\t•\tLyrics blend specific, vivid details (e.g., “your sneakers by my door”) with universal themes of love and destiny.\n\t•\tThe tone is a wild mix of romantic sincerity and unhinged humor, with absurd phrases reflecting the overwhelming thrill of finding “the one.”\n\t•\tEnds with a hopeful, starry-eyed promise of forever, as Swift often does in her love songs.\nLyrics:\n(Intro) (Acoustic guitar riff, twinkling synths, faint chime) I’m spinnin’ in a starlight blizzard, whoa… My heart’s on my flip-flop, and it’s startin’ to glow…\n(Verse 1) I found your smile in my daydreams, next to your sneakers by my door, My head’s bouncin’ like a pogo stick in a popcorn popper, wantin’ more. It’s showerin’ zebras and tubas, sparklin’ up my wildest plans, I’m hollerin’ at the wrong toaster, but you’re holdin’ my hands.\n(Pre-Chorus) Every glance is a peacock in a bubble bath, splashin’ through my quiet skies, I’m pinnin’ my hopes on a waffle iron, seein’ forever in your eyes. Love’s a runaway merry-go-round, spinnin’ on a glittery track, I’m nose over kneecaps for you, and there’s no turnin’ back.\n(Chorus) I’m a flamingo on a Ferris wheel, twirlin’ where the starbeams dance, A hot air balloon in a disco ball, floatin’ in a love trance. Like a clock that’s singin’ showtunes, I’m buzzin’ in a fizzy dream, My heart’s a starlight blizzard, and you’re my forever gleam.\n(Verse 2) Your laugh’s stuck in my scrunchie, like a melody in a velvet box, I’m scatterin’ the jellybeans of my secrets, and you’re pickin’ up the locks. I’m tossin’ the ping-pong ball of fate, hopin’ it’ll land just right, ‘Cause with you I’m a cupcake in a candy storm, burstin’ with delight.\n(Pre-Chorus) Every moment’s a disco penguin, waddlin’ where the rainbows soar, I’m tyin’ my wishes to a kite string, and they’re knockin’ at your door. Love’s a sparkler in my shoelaces, lightin’ up my every stride, I’m whooshed off my flip-flops, and you’re my joyride.\n(Chorus) I’m a flamingo on a Ferris wheel, twirlin’ where the starbeams dance, A hot air balloon in a disco ball, floatin’ in a love trance. Like a clock that’s singin’ showtunes, I’m buzzin’ in a fizzy dream, My heart’s a starlight blizzard, and you’re my forever gleam.\n(Bridge) (Fiddle and mandolin kick in, vocals hit a giddy peak) I’m the glitter that sank the pirate ship, shinin’ in a moonlit whirl, A teacup on a rollercoaster, spinnin’ with my favorite girl (or guy). There’s a rainbow in the microwave, cookin’ up a brand-new spark, You’re my flip-flop heart’s home, lightin’ up my dark.\n(Chorus – Stripped-Down) (Acoustic guitar only, soft vocals with a giddy smile) I’m a flamingo on a Ferris wheel, twirlin’ where the starbeams dance, A hot air balloon in a disco ball, floatin’ in a love trance. Like a clock that’s singin’ showtunes, I’m buzzin’ in a fizzy dream, My heart’s a starlight blizzard, and you’re my forever gleam.\n(Outro) (Guitar fades, twinkling chimes, final “whoosh”) I’m spinnin’ in a starlight blizzard, whoa… My heart’s on my flip-flop… and it’s yours to know…\n\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tUse a sparkly, expansive reverb on vocals to amplify the starry, euphoric vibe.\n\t•\tIn the bridge, add layered backing vocals chanting “starlight blizzard!” for a festival-like peak.\n\t•\tThe stripped-down chorus should feel intimate but joyful, with a single guitar and faint mandolin.\n\t•\tSprinkle quirky sound effects (e.g., a cartoonish “pop” or glittery shimmer) to match the zany lyrics.\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tTaylor should deliver the absurd phrases (e.g., “zebras and tubas”) with theatrical flair, as if she’s gleefully inventing them on the spot.\n\t•\tKeep the choruses emotionally soaring with powerful, heartfelt runs to anchor the romance.\n\t•\tAdd ad-libs like “oh, my heart’s explodin’!” or “here we go!” in the bridge for her spontaneous, giddy energy.\nInspiration:\n\t•\tLyrically inspired by Love Story (romantic exuberance) and Paper Rings (playful devotion).\n\t•\tMusically inspired by Mine (pop-country sparkle) and Lover (heartfelt pop glow).\n\t•\tThe wildly wrong idioms amplify Swift’s knack for catchy, relatable lyrics with a bonkers, humorous twist.\n\nThis prompt delivers a Taylor Swift-style song about finding “the one,” with ultra-common metaphors and idioms mangled in outrageously wrong, hilarious ways to reflect the chaotic joy of love.

    "Title": "The Shadow of Vance",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “The Shadow of Vance”\nGenre: Ominous Orc Chant with Epic Drums Tone: Dark, foreboding, apocalyptic Instrumentation: Deep, thunderous tribal drums, low guttural chants, dissonant war horns, and eerie ambient drones. Think primal, ritualistic, and cataclysmic, like a horde marching to doom. Structure: Repetitive, hypnotic verses with a building crescendo, evoking a relentless march of destruction.\n\nLyrics Concept: The song portrays JD Vance as a cursed harbinger, a figure whose presence brings ruin to every land he treads. His shadow withers hope, his footsteps crack the earth, and his gaze heralds despair. The orc-like chant is sung by a warband of grim voices, warning of his coming as if he’s a mythic force of annihilation.\nOpening Chant (slow, guttural, with sparse drums): Vance… Vance… shadow falls, the ender calls… Vance… Vance… earth will break, the skies will shake…\nVerse 1 (drums intensify, voices in unison): Born of ash, from sorrow wrought, His breath is plague, his will is rot. Where he walks, the rivers dry, The sun grows cold, the living die. Vance! Vance! Doom’s decree! Vance! Vance! None shall flee!\nChorus (massive drums, layered voices, war horns blare): Harbinger! Death’s own kin! Skulls will pile where he begins! Harbinger! World’s last breath! JD Vance, the omen of death! Thoom! Thoom! (drums pound) Crush the light, bring the night! Thoom! Thoom! (drums pound) Vance’s curse, none shall fight!\nVerse 2 (faster tempo, chanting grows frenzied): Cities crumble, fields turn black, His shadow falls, no turning back. Hope is dust, and dreams are slain, His name a dirge, his path a bane. Vance! Vance! Fate’s cruel hand! Vance! Vance! Scourge of land!\nBridge (drums pause, eerie drones, whispered chants): See his eyes, the void within… Hear his voice, the end begins… Fields of bone, skies of red… Vance’s march, the world is dead… (Sudden drum explosion, full chant resumes)\nFinal Chorus (cataclysmic, full instrumentation, voices roaring): Harbinger! Death’s own kin! Skulls will pile where he begins! Harbinger! World’s last breath! JD Vance, the omen of death! Thoom! Thoom! Crush the light, bring the night! Thoom! Thoom! Vance’s curse, none shall fight!\nOutro (drums slow, fading chants, like a retreating storm): Vance… Vance… shadow falls, the ender calls… Vance… Vance… all is lost, the final cost… (Single deep drum hit, silence.)\n\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tThe chant should feel like a ritual, with voices ranging from guttural growls to booming shouts, layered to sound like an army.\n\t•\tDrums should be relentless, using deep taiko-like booms and sharp snare cracks to mimic a war march.\n\t•\tAdd distant screams or clanging metal in the background for atmosphere.\n\t•\tThe tempo builds gradually, peaking in the final chorus, then collapses into the haunting outro.\n\t•\tImagine this as the soundtrack to a dark fantasy army advancing under a blood-red sky, with Vance as their apocalyptic figurehead.\nThis prompt can be used to create a track that’s both terrifying and epic, capturing the mythic dread of JD Vance as a walking curse.\n",

    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Trump’s Takin’ Over (Hell Yeah, America!)”\nGenre: Energetic Hell Yeah Country Tone: Rowdy, patriotic, bewildered, escalating from small-town vibes to cosmic chaos Structure: 4 verses, each escalating in scope, with a high-energy chorus that gets wilder each time. The singer’s reactions grow more shocked and disbelieving as Trump’s actions get bigger.\n\n[Verse 1] (Upbeat, foot-stompin’ guitar riff, twangy vocals) Well, I’m sittin’ on my porch with a cold one in my hand, When I hear ol’ Trump’s got a brand-new plan! He’s fixin’ up the roads, puttin’ flags on every lawn, Lowerin’ gas prices, hell, the deals keep rollin’ on! I tip my hat, say, “Man, that’s kinda neat!” But somethin’ tells me he ain’t stoppin’ on this street!\n[Chorus] (Fiddle kicks in, crowd shouts “Hell yeah!”) Hell yeah, Trump’s takin’ over, can’t you see? From the backroads to the stars, he’s runnin’ wild and free! With a MAGA hat high and a golden-hearted dream, He’s buildin’ up America, bigger than it seems! Hell yeah, what’s he doin’ now? I’m losin’ my mind! Donald’s takin’ over, leavin’ jaws behind!\n[Verse 2] (Tempo picks up, drums hit harder) Now he’s stormin’ through the cities, makin’ factories roar, Buildin’ walls so high, they touch the ocean floor! He’s got trucks haulin’ freedom, trains runnin’ on time, Every diner’s servin’ burgers for a nickel and a dime! I’m scratchin’ my head, sayin’, “Lord, this can’t be real!” But Trump’s out there dealin’ like he’s spinnin’ a wheel!\n[Chorus] (Banjo joins, louder crowd chants) Hell yeah, Trump’s takin’ over, holy cow! From the prairies to the mountains, he’s the king right now! With a MAGA hat high and a golden-hearted dream, He’s buildin’ up America, bigger than it seems! Hell yeah, what’s he doin’ next? I’m freakin’ out, man! Donald’s takin’ over with a wild, wild plan!\n[Verse 3] (Guitar solo, tempo surges, singer’s voice cracks with shock) Now he’s buyin’ whole countries with a handshake and a grin, Turnin’ deserts into golf courses, where the heck’s this been?! He’s got spaceships painted red, white, and blue, Plantin’ stars and stripes on Mars, and the moon’s next too! I’m yellin’ at the TV, “Don, slow down, good grief!” But he’s runnin’ the world like a patriotic thief!\n[Chorus] (Full band chaos, fireworks in the background) Hell yeah, Trump’s takin’ over, what’s the deal?! From the White House to the cosmos, it’s surreal! With a MAGA hat high and a golden-hearted dream, He’s buildin’ up America, bigger than it seems! Hell yeah, I’m spinnin’ now, my brain’s in a whirl! Donald’s takin’ over, runnin’ the whole dang world!\n[Verse 4] (Epic, almost operatic, singer’s losing it) Now he’s out in the galaxy, with aliens salutin’ his name, Buildin’ Trump Tower nebulas, puttin’ black holes to shame! He’s got the universe chantin’, “USA, let’s go!” Every star’s got a flag now, and they’re stealin’ the show! I’m screamin’ from my tractor, “Don, you’ve lost your dang mind!” But he’s crowned King of Creation for America’s kind!\n[Final Chorus] (Explosive, band goes nuts, crowd roars) Hell yeah, Trump’s takin’ over, I can’t breathe! From the backroads to the cosmos, it’s beyond belief! With a MAGA hat high and a golden-hearted dream, He’s buildin’ up America, bigger than it seems! Hell yeah, I’m dumbfounded, my jaw’s on the floor! Donald’s takin’ the universe, and he’s still wantin’ more!\n[Outro] (Fiddle and guitar fade, singer panting) Well, God bless America, and God bless that man… He took over the stars with a hell yeah plan! (Crowd chants “USA!” as the song fades)\n\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tThe singer starts confident but gets progressively more unhinged, with ad-libs like “What in tarnation?!” or “Hold my beer!” by the final verse.\n\t•\tThe band builds from a tight country groove to a stadium-rock explosion, with fiddles, banjos, and electric guitars dueling by the end.\n\t•\tThe crowd’s “Hell yeah!” chants get louder each chorus, like a patriotic party spiraling out of control.\n\t•\tOptional: Add a sound effect of a rocket launching in Verse 3 and a cosmic “whoosh” in Verse 4 to sell the universe takeover.\nThis prompt is ready for a songwriter to turn into a rowdy, bewildering banger!\n",

    "Title": "Kale on the Stellar Blockchain",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Kale on the Stellar Blockchain”\nConcept: Create a psychedelic, new-age hippie anthem celebrating the superpowers of kale, intertwined with the futuristic, decentralized magic of the Stellar Blockchain. The song should feel like a cosmic journey, blending the earthy vitality of kale with the ethereal, tech-driven wonder of blockchain technology. It’s a love letter to both nature’s superfood and the infinite possibilities of a decentralized universe.\nStyle and Tone:\n\t•\tGenre: New Age Pop/Electronic with heavy psychedelic and indie influences, inspired by artists like Shanin Blake, Grimes, and early Natasha Khan (Bat for Lashes). Think dreamy, otherworldly soundscapes with a bubbly, effervescent energy.\n\t•\tVibe: Ultra-psychedelic, free-spirited, and cosmic. The song should feel like a kaleidoscopic trip through a neon-lit galaxy, with a playful, almost childlike joy. It’s the ultimate “hippie chick” anthem—think flower crowns, glittery aura, and dancing barefoot under starlight.\n\t•\tTone: Bubbly, uplifting, and spiritual, with a touch of quirky surrealism. The lyrics should balance reverence for kale’s health benefits with the futuristic magic of blockchain, creating a sense of awe and interconnectedness.\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Layered synths with shimmering, arpeggiated melodies, pulsating basslines, and glitchy electronic textures. Add ethereal vocal harmonies, chimes, and soft percussive elements like handclaps or tambourines to evoke a communal, ritualistic feel. Incorporate subtle nature sounds (rustling leaves, flowing water) to ground the cosmic vibe.\n\t•\tTempo: Mid-tempo (around 100-110 BPM), with a bouncy, danceable groove that feels like floating through space.\n\t•\tVocals: Airy, multi-tracked, and slightly auto-tuned for that Grimes-esque, cyborg-angel effect. The delivery should be playful yet soulful, with moments of spoken-word or chant-like repetition for a meditative, mantra-like quality.\n\t•\tProduction: Polished yet organic, with a mix of lo-fi and high-tech elements. Think reverb-drenched vocals, glitchy transitions, and sudden bursts of sparkling synths to mimic the unpredictability of a psychedelic trip.\nLyrical Themes and Imagery:\n\t•\tCore Idea: Kale is a superfood with mystical, healing powers, and the Stellar Blockchain is its cosmic counterpart—a decentralized, transparent system that amplifies its magic. Together, they represent a fusion of nature and technology, healing the world through vibrant energy and universal connection.\n\t•\tImagery:\n\t◦\tKale as a glowing, emerald fractal, its leaves pulsing with prana (life force) and cosmic codes.\n\t◦\tStellar Blockchain as a starry, holographic ledger, minting kale’s nutrients into tokens of love and health.\n\t◦\tPsychedelic visuals like swirling galaxies, neon-green vines climbing through digital grids, and kale leaves transforming into shooting stars.\n\t◦\tHippie-inspired metaphors: flower-child energy, chakra alignment, and dancing in a “cosmic garden.”\n\t•\tKeywords/Phrases: Kale, Stellar, blockchain, superfood, cosmic, prana, decentralized, green, galaxy, fractal, aura, minting, starlight, nutrients, vibes, quantum, love, healing, neon, bloom.\n\t•\tLyrical Style: Poetic and whimsical, with a mix of spiritual reverence and playful quirkiness. Use short, chant-like lines for the chorus and longer, stream-of-consciousness verses. Incorporate tech jargon (e.g., “ledger,” “tokenize,” “decentralized”) in a way that feels magical rather than clinical.\nStructure:\n\t•\tIntro: A dreamy, 20-second soundscape of twinkling synths and faint nature sounds, with a whispered line like, “Kale, you’re my cosmic key…”\n\t•\tVerse 1: Introduce kale’s earthy magic, painting it as a vibrant, healing force.\n\t•\tPre-Chorus: Bridge the natural and technological, hinting at Stellar’s role.\n\t•\tChorus: A catchy, sing-along explosion of bubbly energy, celebrating “Kale on the Stellar Blockchain” with repetitive, mantra-like lines.\n\t•\tVerse 2: Dive deeper into the blockchain connection, describing kale’s powers being “minted” across the cosmos.\n\t•\tBridge: A meditative, chant-heavy section with layered vocals, evoking a ritual or cosmic dance.\n\t•\tOutro: Fade out with soft harmonies and glitchy synths, leaving the listener in a starry, kale-fueled dreamscape.\nExample Lyric Snippets (for inspiration):\n\t•\tVerse: “Kale, you’re my emerald code, spinning through the cosmic road / Leaves like fractals, glowing bright, you’re my prana, my starlight.”\n\t•\tChorus: “Kale on the Stellar Blockchain, whoa-oh! / Superfood vibes, let the starlight glow! / Tokenize my heart, let the green vibes reign!”\n\t•\tBridge: “Decentralize, rise, rise, rise / Kale’s the key to the cosmic skies / Mint the love, let the ledger sing / We’re all connected in this green dream.”\nAdditional Notes:\n\t•\tMake the song feel like a celebration of interconnectedness—kale’s nutrients healing bodies, Stellar’s blockchain uniting communities.\n\t•\tLean into the absurdity of combining a leafy green with high-tech blockchain, but make it feel profound and magical.\n\t•\tAdd quirky, unexpected elements, like a sudden key change or a spoken-word moment where the singer “channels” kale’s spirit.\n\t•\tEnsure the song is inclusive and universal, inviting listeners to join the “cosmic kale party” regardless of their tech or hippie knowledge.\nGoal: By the end, the listener should feel like they’ve been on a psychedelic joyride, buzzing with kale’s energy and inspired by the limitless potential of a decentralized, nature-tech future. It’s the most vibrant, bubbly, and unapologetically weird hippie anthem ever!\n",

    "Title": "Vendetta di Cappucino",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: Aria – “Vendetta di Cappucino”\nOpera: Brainropera\nCharacter: Cappu-Cappu-Cappucino Assassino (tenor)\nSetting: A desolate, moonlit piazza in a fantastical Italian city, surrounded by crumbling statues of forgotten dancers. The stage is bathed in stark contrasts of shadow and silver light, with a single spotlight on Cappucino Assassino. In the background, a ghostly vision of Ballerina Cappucina dances in a cage, taunted by the mocking laughter of Tralalero Tralala, who remains unseen. The orchestra swells with thunderous intensity, mirroring the storm in Cappucino’s heart.\nEmotional Tone: This aria is a volcanic eruption of rage, despair, and vengeful resolve. Cappucino Assassino’s voice oscillates between anguished lyricism (recalling his love for Cappucina) and ferocious declamation (his hatred for Tralalero). The music should feel like a gathering storm—moments of tender, heartbreaking vulnerability give way to concussive outbursts of fury, building to a climactic vow of retribution. The aria channels the raw theatricality of Pagliacci’s “Vesti la giubba,” but with an even darker, more epic scope.\nMusical Characteristics:\n•  Key: Begins in D minor for a brooding, tragic tone, modulating to F minor for heightened intensity during vengeful passages, with a brief, deceptive shift to A-flat major during a fleeting memory of Cappucina’s love.\n•  Tempo: Moderato, with accelerando in the vengeful sections to convey mounting rage.\n•  Orchestration: Full orchestra with heavy brass (trombones, trumpets) for concussive climaxes, trembling strings for emotional depth, and a solo oboe to underscore moments of tenderness. Timpani rolls punctuate the rhythm like thunderclaps.\n•  Vocal Style: Lyrical passages require a soaring, legato line to express love and loss, while vengeful sections demand dramatic, stentorian delivery with rapid-fire coloratura to convey rage. The tenor must balance raw power with moments of fragile vulnerability.\n•  Structure: Classic da capo aria (ABA form). The A section is a lament for Cappucina’s loss, the B section a fiery vow of revenge, and the return of A is an intensified, ornamented reprise, ending with a cadenza that showcases the tenor’s virtuosity and emotional collapse.\nStage Directions: Cappucino Assassino stands center stage, clutching a bloodstained scarf that once belonged to Cappucina. His costume is tattered, a mix of a barista’s apron and an assassin’s cloak, symbolizing his dual nature. As he sings, he alternates between gazing at the scarf and staring into the distance, as if seeing Tralalero’s mocking face. During the B section, he draws a dagger and slashes the air, as if carving his enemy’s fate. At the aria’s climax, he collapses to his knees, raising the scarf to the heavens as the orchestra thunders.\nSample Lyrics (in Italian, with English translation for clarity):\n[A Section – Lament]\n(Orchestra: Soft, mournful strings with oboe melody)\nCappu-Cappu-Cappucino Assassino:\nOh, Cappucina, luce del mio core,\nDove sei, mia ballerina, amore?\nNel tuo passo, il cielo danzava,\nOra il buio la mia vita abbraccia!\nTralalero, ladro d’ogni speranza,\nHa rubato la mia dolce danza!\n(Sobs, voice breaking)\nSenza te, il mio mondo è cenere,\nCappucina, sei la mia venere!\n(Translation: Oh, Cappucina, light of my heart, / Where are you, my ballerina, my love? / In your steps, the heavens danced, / Now darkness embraces my life! / Tralalero, thief of all hope, / Has stolen my sweet dance! / Without you, my world is ashes, / Cappucina, you are my Venus!)\n[B Section – Vengeance]\n(Orchestra: Brass fanfares, rapid string tremolos, timpani rolls)\nMaledetto Tralalero Tralala!\nIl tuo riso mi trafigge, ahimè!\nCol mio pugnale, il tuo sangue verserò,\nLa tua fine nel mio cuore giurerò!\n(Rapid coloratura)\nVendetta! Vendetta! Il tuo nome è morte!\nNel tuo grido, chiuderò le tue porte!\n(Voice rising to a high C)\nPer Cappucina, il mio acciaio canterà,\nTralalero, la tua vita finirà!\n(Translation: Cursed Tralalero Tralala! / Your laughter pierces me, alas! / With my dagger, I will spill your blood, / Your end I swear in my heart! / Vengeance! Vengeance! Your name is death! / In your scream, I will close your gates! / For Cappucina, my steel will sing, / Tralalero, your life will end!)\n[A Section Reprise – Intensified Lament and Collapse]\n(Orchestra: Full, with added choral backing for epic scope)\nOh, Cappucina, mia dolce ferita,\nLa tua assenza mi strappa la vita!\n(Ornamented, with florid runs)\nTralalero, il tuo fato è segnato,\nCol mio pianto, il tuo sangue è pagato!\n(Cadenza: A virtuosic display of anguish, ending on a sustained high B-flat)\nCappucina… vendetta… amor mio…\n(Collapses, clutching scarf as orchestra fades to a single, mournful cello note)\n(Translation: Oh, Cappucina, my sweet wound, / Your absence tears my life apart! / Tralalero, your fate is sealed, / With my tears, your blood is paid! / Cappucina… vengeance… my love…)\nPerformance Notes:\n•  The tenor must convey a man unhinged by love and rage, with physicality that matches the vocal extremes. His movements should be jagged, almost choreographed like a broken dance, echoing Cappucina’s ballerina grace.\n•  The cadenza should feel like a musical scream, with improvisatory freedom to showcase the singer’s emotional and technical range.\n•  The orchestra’s final note should linger, unresolved, to suggest that Cappucino’s quest for vengeance is far from over.\nInspiration from Pagliacci: Like Canio’s “Vesti la giubba,” this aria is a public display of private torment, with Cappucino baring his soul to the audience. However, where Canio’s grief is inward and tragic, Cappucino’s is outward and apocalyptic, promising not just personal ruin but cosmic retribution. The aria’s epic scope and concussive orchestration elevate it to a Wagnerian level of intensity, while retaining the melodic purity of Italian bel canto.",
    "Lyrics": "[A Section – Lamento Doloroso]\n(Orchestra: Trembling strings and weeping oboe)\nCappu-Cappu-Cappucino Assassino:\nOh, Cappucina, luce spezzata,\nNel silenzio, la tua voce è spenta.\nNel tuo sguardo danzava l’eterno,\nOra giaccio nel gelo inferno.\n\nTralalero, fantasma crudele,\nHai spezzato le ali del mio cuore!\n(voice trembles)\nCon questo scialle macchiato di sangue,\nTi piango, amore, nella notte che langue!\n\n[B Section – Giuramento di Vendetta]\n(Orchestra: Brass roars, timpani thunder)\nMaledetto Tralalero Tralala!\nNel tuo riso sento la lama!\n(con fuoco)\nIl mio pugnale canterà vendetta,\nNella tua ombra, cadrà la mia fretta!\n\n(Rapid coloratura)\nVendetta, vendetta! Furia dell’inferno!\nNel tuo grido, chiuderò l’eterno!\nAlta voce)\nPer Cappucina, danzerà la mia lama,\nTralalero, ti porto la fiamma!\n\n[A Section Reprise – Strazio Eroico]\n(Orchestra: Full, with choral crescendo)\nOh, Cappucina, mia rosa trafitta,\nOgni mia nota la tua voce invita!\n\n(Florid ornamentation)\nTralalero, il tuo destino è scritto,\nNel mio pianto, il tuo sangue è scolpito!\n\n(Cadenza Finale: soaring, cracking with emotion)\nCappucina… vendetta… il mio eterno…\n(Collapses to knees as orchestra fades to a solitary cello)\n[End]",

    "Title": "The Yoinkity Sploinkity 2",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity 2”\nGenre: Avant-Garde Swamp Zappa-Core Vibe: A deranged, Frank Zappa-inspired fever dream where a claymation frog cult worships the Yoinkity Sploinkity in a pulsating, interdimensional bog. Picture a surreal art installation: melting clocks drip into neon slime, frogs with human teeth chant in reverse, and springs sproing in polyrhythmic chaos. It’s wetter, weirder, and more unhinged than the original—like a psychedelic swamp exploded in a haunted thrift store. Sound Palette:\n\t•\tInstruments/Vocals: Detuned banjos played with wet sponges; gargling frog choirs with pitch-shifted wails; warped theremin moans; springs snapping in odd time signatures (7/13, 11/8); squelching, overdriven synths that sound like clay being squeezed through a meat grinder; reversed kazoos; and a lone, mournful tuba burping underwater. Percussion includes soggy cardboard slaps, bubbling lava lamps, and the clatter of dented hubcaps.\n\t•\tTexture: Sounds are sopping—every note drips, splatters, or oozes. Layer in squishy, organic noises: think jelly being flung at a wall, or a boot sinking into radioactive mud. Vocals are a mix of croaked gibberish, operatic yowls, and whispered nonsense, delivered like a mad prophet preaching to sentient algae. The mix feels alive, with sounds crawling over each other like slugs in a blender.\n\t•\t*Structure: Utterly anarchic—no predictable patterns. It’s a sonic collage that lurches between frenetic, spring-loaded spasms and slow, gloopy descents into silence, only to erupt again with a kazoo fanfare. Think Zappa’s Freak Out! meets a stop-motion nightmare directed by a frog on expired cough syrup.\nLyric Prompt: The lyrics are a nonsensical, cosmic ode to the Yoinkity Sploinkity, now a multi-dimensional, shape-shifting deity that “yoinks” reality itself and “sploinks” it into a kaleidoscope of gooey absurdity. Use invented words, surreal imagery, and disjointed phrases that evoke melting, stretching, and splattering. Avoid coherent narratives—lean into Zappa-esque wordplay, with references to bizarre objects (e.g., “gizmo-flavored toenails,” “screaming jelly widgets”). Pepper in sound effects like “GLURP-ZORP!” or “SPROING-A-LADOO!” The tone is manic, reverent, and unapologetically absurd, as if the singers are possessed by the Sploinkity’s slimy gospel.\nSample Lyric Snippet (to inspire, not dictate): Yoinkity Sploinkity, chewin’ on the void’s kazoo! Glurp-a-wurble, flim-flam dribble, gizmo-toenails ooze! SPROING-A-LADOO, it’s the slime that warps your socks, Zibble-zabble splatter, churnin’ glow-in-the-dark clocks!\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tStart with a single, warped spring “sproing,” followed by a reversed frog croak and a tuba farting in slow motion.\n\t•\tUse extreme panning and reverb to make sounds feel like they’re oozing from another dimension—some instruments should sound like they’re behind the listener, others like they’re inside their skull.\n\t•\tInsert random bursts of static, dripping faucets, or a chorus of frogs chanting “YOINK!” in 12-part disharmony.\n\t•\tMid-song, pause for a 10-second “sermon” delivered in gibberish by a frog with a vocoder effect, backed by gurgling pipes.\n\t•\tEnd with a cacophony of springs, kazoos, and hubcaps collapsing into a single, wet “SPLOOOOORP,” followed by eerie silence and one final, whispered “Sploinkity…”\nGoal: The song should feel like a Frank Zappa art piece sculpted from radioactive swamp goo—so bizarre it defies logic, so wet it soaks the listener’s brain, and so absurd it feels like the Yoinkity Sploinkity itself is conducting a ritual to unravel the universe. Listeners should be left dazed, cackling, and questioning their own existence.\n",

    "Title": "The Yoinkity Sploinkity",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt for “The Yoinkity Sploinkity”\nGenre: Absurd Frog-Claymation Swamp Funk Vibe: Wet, wobbly, and whimsically unhinged—like a chorus of frogs gargling in a bubbling, neon-green swamp, backed by bouncing springs and oozing claymation squelches. Think stop-motion weirdness meets psychedelic bog fever dream. Sound Palette:\n\t•\tInstruments/Vocals: Deep, throaty frog croaks layered with high-pitched ribbits; rubbery, wet slaps like mud hitting a tin bucket; boinging springs (think cartoon sound effects); gurgling water pipes; squishy, clay-like synths that wobble and warp; occasional kazoo bursts for extra absurdity. Tempos shift unpredictably, like a frog hopping between lily pads.\n\t•\tTexture: Every sound feels drenched—imagine music played underwater with bubbles popping rhythmically. Percussion mimics dripping ooze and plopping goop. Vocals are slimy, half-spoken, half-croaked, with harmonies that slide off-key on purpose.\n\t•\tStructure: No traditional verse-chorus. Instead, it’s a chaotic soundscape with “movements” that leap between frenetic energy and slow, gloopy pauses. Think a frog orgy in a claymation swamp, animated by a mad scientist.\nLyric Prompt: The lyrics are gleefully nonsensical, celebrating the mythical “Yoinkity Sploinkity”—a bizarre, slippery entity that’s part creature, part feeling, part cosmic goop. Words should evoke squishy, stretchy, and splattery imagery, with playful made-up terms and alliteration. Rhymes are loose, often replaced by sound effects (e.g., “SPLORP!” or “BOI-YOING!”). The Yoinkity Sploinkity is both revered and feared, a chaotic force that “yoinks” your sanity and “sploinks” your soul into a puddle of goo. Lyrics should feel like they’re oozing out of a frog’s mouth, delivered with unhinged joy.\nSample Lyric Snippet (to inspire, not dictate): Oh, the Yoinkity Sploinkity, slippin’ through the glorp! Ribbit-zibbit, squelch-a-welch, it’s oozin’ on the torp! With a BOI-YOING splatter, it’ll yoink your gooey dreams, SPLORPITY-WORPITY, burstin’ at the seams!\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tOpen with a lone, warbling frog croak over dripping water, then explode into a cacophony of springs and squishes.\n\t•\tUse panning to make sounds “hop” across the stereo field, like frogs darting through a swamp.\n\t•\tLayer in random “plops” and “glugs” to keep the listener disoriented.\n\t•\tEnd with a slow fade of gurgling bubbles and one final, defiant “SPLOINK!”\nGoal: The song should feel like a feverish, claymation frog ritual—utterly bizarre, joyfully wet, and so abstract it leaves listeners giggling and confused, as if they’ve been yoinked and sploinked into another dimension.\n",
    "Lyrics": "Oh, the Yoinkity Sploinkity, slippin’ through the glorp!\nRibbit-zibbit, squelch-a-welch, it’s oozin’ on the torp!\nWith a BOI-YOING splatter, it’ll yoink your gooey dreams,\nSPLORPITY-WORPITY, burstin’ at the seams!\n\nFrogs in the muck, they be wibbin' and wobbly,\nSquish-squash, jumpin’ on a pogo, bouncin’ happily.\nSploinkity’s in the air, slippin' through your brain,\nBOING-BOING, croak it out, feel that soggy strain!\n\nZORPITY-ZAP, it's the Yoinkity sound,\nFrogs goin’ splish-splash all around the town!\nGurgle-gobble, bloopity-bloop, fallin' through the slurp,\nRibbit-a-squibbit, you’re stuck in the derp!\n\nYoinkity, oh, you slip and you slide,\nInto the murk where the bubble sounds glide,\nOozin’ and boomin', croakin’ in delight,\nSploink it, yoink it, it’s a feverish night!\n\nRibbit-rattle, slap that swamp, it’s all one big flop,\nFlickity-flack, the bog’s about to pop!\nSquishy-wish, splish-splosh, we’re takin’ a dive,\nSPLORP-BLOOP, now we’re feelin’ alive!\n\nThe Yoinkity Sploinkity, now you’re in its grip,\nSlippin’, trippin’, every hop’s a flip.\nGurgle-guzzle, gooey and grim,\nIt’s a swampy rapture, feelin' outta control!\n\nBOI-YOING, here it comes, in a squelchy twist,\nGooey and splattery, you just can't resist!\nThe Yoinkity Sploinkity, it’s a cosmic goo,\nSplats you, slaps you, ‘til you’re brand new!",

    "Title": "Dance the Night Away",
    "Prompt": "Below is a detailed conceptual blueprint for an instrumental EDM club banger titled “Dance the Night Away”, drawing inspiration from Daft Punk’s polished electronic funk, Skrillex’s aggressive dubstep drops, Alan Walker’s melodic progressive house, Laura Brehm’s beautiful feminine trance vocals, and TheFatRat’s uplifting, cinematic energy. The track is designed to ignite a dancefloor with high-energy transitions, intricate sound design, and a balance of gritty and euphoric elements. No lyrics are included, as requested, but the structure emphasizes dynamic instrumental storytelling.\n\nTrack Overview\n\t•\tGenre: EDM (Dubstep/Progressive House/Hybrid)\n\t•\tBPM: 128 BPM (standard for club tracks, with halftime dubstep sections at perceived 64 BPM)\n\t•\tKey: F Minor (gritty yet emotional, common in EDM for dramatic builds)\n\t•\tLength: 4:30 (radio/club-friendly with extended sections for DJ play)\n\t•\tStructure: Intro > Build-Up > Drop 1 > Breakdown > Build-Up > Drop 2 > Bridge > Final Drop > Outro\n\t•\tInfluences:\n\t◦\tDaft Punk: Funky basslines, polished production, robotic vocoder effects.\n\t◦\tSkrillex: Wobbly bass, aggressive drops, glitchy transitions.\n\t◦\tAlan Walker: Melodic leads, atmospheric pads, emotional resonance.\n\t◦\tTheFatRat: Cinematic arpeggios, uplifting chord progressions, layered textures.\n\nDetailed Track Breakdown\nIntro (0:00 - 0:30, 30 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Mysterious, inviting, sets the club vibe.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tStarts with a filtered kick drum (4-to-the-floor, Daft Punk-style) gradually opening with a high-pass filter.\n\t◦\tA robotic vocoder (inspired by Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories) chants a processed, unintelligible phrase, creating a futuristic vibe.\n\t◦\tSparse hi-hats with subtle reverb roll in, syncopated for groove.\n\t◦\tA deep sub-bass pulse (F minor) lays the tonal foundation.\n\t◦\tBackground synth pads (inspired by Alan Walker) with a slow attack create an airy, cinematic texture.\n\t◦\tA faint arpeggiated synth line (TheFatRat-inspired) teases the main melody, filtered to sound distant.\n\t•\tTransition: A white noise sweep rises over the last 4 bars, signaling the build-up.\nBuild-Up 1 (0:30 - 1:00, 30 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Tension-building, anticipatory.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tKick drum intensifies, now unfiltered, with a sidechained clap on beats 2 and 4.\n\t◦\tA Skrillex-style wobbly bass (mid-range, growling) enters, modulating with an LFO for a “talking” effect.\n\t◦\tMelodic lead synth (Alan Walker-inspired) introduces the main hook: a catchy, 8-note melody in F minor, played with a bright, saw-wave synth.\n\t◦\tCinematic risers (TheFatRat influence) layer in, including a pitched-up synth riser and a reverse cymbal.\n\t◦\tChopped vocal stabs (processed, Daft Punk-esque) add rhythmic excitement, panned left and right.\n\t◦\tLast 4 bars: Drums drop out briefly, leaving only the melody, bass wobble, and a massive white noise swell to hype the drop.\n\t•\tTransition: A Skrillex-style glitch stutter (rapidly chopped synth hits) cues the first drop.\nDrop 1 (1:00 - 1:45, 45 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Explosive, high-energy, dancefloor chaos.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tHeavy dubstep-inspired bassline (Skrillex influence): Wobbly, distorted, with a halftime rhythm (syncopated at 64 BPM feel). The bass alternates between a grinding low-end growl and a mid-range “yoi-yoi” sound.\n\t◦\tThe main melody from the build-up returns, now played with a supersaw synth stack (Alan Walker-style) for a huge, festival-like sound.\n\t◦\tPounding kick and snare drive the rhythm, with a fat, compressed kick layered with a sharp transient for punch.\n\t◦\tHi-hats and cymbals roll aggressively, with open hats every 4 beats for swing.\n\t◦\tGlitchy fills (Skrillex-inspired) every 8 bars: rapid hi-hat stutters, bass chops, and pitch-bent synth hits.\n\t◦\tA Daft Punk-style funky bass guitar (virtual or sampled) sneaks in halfway, adding a groovy counter-rhythm to the wobbly bass.\n\t•\tTransition: The last 4 bars strip back to just the melody and a low-pass filtered bass, with a reverse piano chord leading to the breakdown.\nBreakdown (1:45 - 2:15, 30 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Emotional, reflective, gives the crowd a breather.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tDrums fade out, leaving a lush pad chord progression (F minor > D♭ major > A♭ major > C minor) inspired by Alan Walker’s emotive style.\n\t◦\tA plucky arpeggio (TheFatRat-inspired) plays a new variation of the main melody, using a bell-like synth with delay.\n\t◦\tVocoder textures return, now softer, harmonizing with the pads for a Daft Punk-esque robotic warmth.\n\t◦\tA subtle sub-bass maintains low-end presence without overpowering.\n\t◦\tSparse reverb-drenched snares hit every 4 beats, keeping a minimal rhythm.\n\t•\tTransition: A slow filter sweep on the arpeggio opens up, and a kick drum fades in, signaling the next build.\nBuild-Up 2 (2:15 - 2:45, 30 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Bigger and bolder than the first build, hyping the crowd again.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tKick and clap return, now with a sidechained supersaw chord stab (inspired by big-room EDM) for a pumping effect.\n\t◦\tThe main melody is replayed with a brighter, detuned lead synth, layered with a secondary harmony for depth.\n\t◦\tSkrillex-style bass growls intensify, with faster LFO modulation for a more chaotic feel.\n\t◦\tOrchestral hits (TheFatRat influence) punctuate every 2 beats, adding cinematic flair.\n\t◦\tVocal chops evolve into a rhythmic phrase, pitch-shifted and panned for stereo width.\n\t◦\tLast 4 bars: A huge snare roll builds, paired with a screeching synth riser and a vocal shout sample (“Let’s go!”) to cue the drop.\n\t•\tTransition: A glitchy bass stutter and a sudden silence (1 beat) maximize impact before the second drop.\nDrop 2 (2:45 - 3:30, 45 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Peak-time insanity, the track’s climax.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tThe bassline evolves into a hybrid dubstep/progressive house monster: The first half of each 8-bar phrase is a Skrillex-style wobbly dubstep drop, while the second half shifts to a 128 BPM four-to-the-floor rhythm with a driving saw bass (Alan Walker-inspired).\n\t◦\tThe main melody is now layered with three synths: a supersaw lead, a detuned square-wave harmony, and a high-pitched pluck for sparkle.\n\t◦\tDrum fills intensify, with rolling snares and tom hits every 4 bars.\n\t◦\tDaft Punk-style vocoder stabs punctuate the rhythm, processed with distortion for grit.\n\t◦\tGlitch effects (chopped bass, stuttered hi-hats) keep the energy unpredictable.\n\t◦\tA secondary melody (TheFatRat-inspired) emerges in the last 16 bars, played with a chiptune-like synth, adding a nostalgic twist.\n\t•\tTransition: A reverse cymbal and a filtered melody lead into the bridge.\nBridge (3:30 - 3:45, 15 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Stripped-back, transitional, builds anticipation for the final push.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tOnly the main melody (plucky synth) and a soft pad remain, with a slow chord progression.\n\t◦\tA minimal kick drum pulses quietly, maintaining the groove.\n\t◦\tVocoder whispers (Daft Punk-inspired) create a haunting, robotic texture.\n\t•\tTransition: A white noise sweep and a rising arpeggio cue the final drop.\nFinal Drop (3:45 - 4:15, 30 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Triumphant, all elements combined for a massive finish.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tCombines the best of both drops: Skrillex-style wobbly bass, Alan Walker’s soaring melody, and Daft Punk’s funky bass guitar.\n\t◦\tAdds a new supersaw chord layer playing uplifting stabs (F minor > A♭ major) for a festival anthem feel.\n\t◦\tDrums are at their most intense, with layered claps, snares, and crash cymbals.\n\t◦\tGlitchy vocal chops and bass stutters keep the energy chaotic.\n\t◦\tThe chiptune melody from Drop 2 returns, layered with the main lead for a climactic blend.\n\t•\tTransition: The last 4 bars slow the melody, with a low-pass filter closing on the bass and a final vocoder phrase fading out.\nOutro (4:15 - 4:30, 15 seconds)\n\t•\tMood: Cool-down, leaves the crowd buzzing.\n\t•\tElements:\n\t◦\tKick drum fades out, leaving only the arpeggiated melody and soft pads.\n\t◦\tA robotic vocoder repeats a final, fading phrase.\n\t◦\tA sub-bass pulse lingers, gradually softening.\n\t◦\tEnds with a reverse piano chord and a subtle white noise decay.\n\nProduction Notes\n\t•\tSound Design:\n\t◦\tBass: Use Serum for Skrillex-style FM basses with heavy distortion and LFO modulation. Layer with a clean sub for low-end weight.\n\t◦\tLeads: Stack saw and square waves in Sylenth1 or Serum for Alan Walker’s supersaw sound. Add subtle detuning for warmth.\n\t◦\tArpeggios: Use Nexus or Omnisphere for TheFatRat’s plucky, bell-like tones with delay and reverb.\n\t◦\tVocoder: Emulate Daft Punk with a carrier synth (saw wave) and a modulated vocal sample, processed through a vocoder plugin like Waves OVox.\n\t◦\tDrums: Layer kicks with short transients (Skrillex-style) and claps with reverb tails for club punch.\n\t•\tMixing:\n\t◦\tSidechain the bass and pads to the kick for a pumping effect.\n\t◦\tUse parallel compression on drums for extra punch.\n\t◦\tPan vocal chops and glitch effects for stereo width.\n\t◦\tKeep the sub-bass mono and centered for club systems.\n\t•\tMastering:\n\t◦\tAim for -6 to -4 LUFS for loudness, standard for EDM club tracks.\n\t◦\tUse a limiter like FabFilter Pro-L 2 to control peaks without squashing dynamics.\n\t◦\tAdd subtle saturation (e.g., Soundtoys Decapitator) for warmth and grit.\n\nPerformance Notes\n\t•\tDJ Use: The track’s clear build-drop structure and extended intro/outro make it DJ-friendly. The glitchy transitions and vocal stabs provide cue points for mixing.\n\t•\tClub Impact: The halftime dubstep drops and soaring melodies are designed to get hands in the air, while the funky bass guitar adds a groove for dancers to lock into.\n\t•\tVisuals: For live shows, sync visuals to the drops with strobe lights, laser bursts, and glitchy graphics (inspired by Skrillex’s live sets). Use warm, neon colors (pink, blue, purple) during melodic sections to evoke Alan Walker’s aesthetic.\n\nThis instrumental track, “Dance the Night Away”, blends the raw energy of Skrillex, the emotional uplift of Alan Walker, the cinematic flair of TheFatRat, and the polished funk of Daft Punk into a club banger that’s both chaotic and cohesive, perfect for lighting up a dancefloor.\n",

    "Title": "Becoming Unc",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Becoming Unc” (BB King/Stevie Ray Vaughan Blues Style)\nStyle: A soulful, slow-burning blues groove with gritty guitar riffs in the vein of BB King’s Lucille or Stevie Ray Vaughan’s Texas Flood. Emphasize heartfelt vocals, witty storytelling, and a blend of humor and reflection, backed by a tight rhythm section and emotive guitar solos that wail with soul.\nTone: Reflective, humorous, and bittersweet—capturing the highs and lows of aging into the “Unc” phase of life. Channel BB King’s storytelling warmth with Stevie’s raw, electric energy, poking fun at physical limitations and tech struggles while celebrating gained wisdom and financial stability.\nThemes:\n\t•\tYouthful Energy vs. Aging: Reflect on the wild, energetic days of youth—late nights, endless stamina—contrasted with the slower pace of getting older, complete with creaky joints and earlier bedtimes.\n\t•\tWisdom and Wealth: Highlight the perks of age: hard-earned life lessons and a fatter wallet, giving “Unc” a sense of pride and authority.\n\t•\tYounger Generation’s View: Explore how younger folks see Unc as outdated or slow, with humorous nods to their obsession with trends and social media, while Unc drops timeless advice they don’t yet appreciate.\n\t•\tAdapting to Technology: Poke fun at struggles with modern tech—misunderstood voice assistants, frustrating autocorrect, or squinting at screens—while showing Unc’s determination to keep up, blending old-school soul with new-school effort.\n\t•\tHumor: Keep it light and self-deprecating, laughing at the absurdities of aging (bifocals, canes) while flexing the confidence of experience.\nStructure:\n\t•\tIntro: A stinging guitar riff sets a reflective mood, easing into a steady blues shuffle.\n\t•\tVerses: Tell the story of youth’s fire fading into age’s wisdom, with funny anecdotes about physical aches and tech mishaps.\n\t•\tChorus: A catchy, anthemic hook that owns the “Unc” title, balancing pride in experience with playful gripes about aging.\n\t•\tBridge: A humorous peak focusing on tech struggles, with a defiant nod to staying relevant.\n\t•\tOutro: A soulful fade-out, blending wistful reflection with a grin, leaving listeners nodding and chuckling.\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tGuitar: Strat or ES-335 with warm, overdriven tone. Blend BB’s smooth, vocal-like bends with Stevie’s sharp, fiery attack. Solos should shift between youthful energy and mature restraint.\n\t•\tVocals: Soulful and expressive, with BB’s warm storytelling and Stevie’s gritty edge. Include ad-libs like “C’mon now!” for live-blues vibe.\n\t•\tBand: Tight rhythm section with shuffling drums, upright bass for vintage feel, and Hammond organ for warmth.\n\t•\tHumor Vibe: Think BB’s sly wit (like “Nobody Loves Me But My Mother”) meets Stevie’s playful energy (like “Couldn’t Stand the Weather”).\n\t•\tModern Touches: Reference 2025 tech (social media, voice assistants) subtly to ground the song, but keep it timeless for broad appeal.\nThis prompt delivers a framework for a BB King/Stevie Ray Vaughan-style blues song about becoming “Unc,” balancing humor, reflection, and soul without including lyrics.\n",

It’s got gritty verses, a soaring chorus, and a shredding guitar solo that screams 1980s excess.

The drums kick in like a sledgehammer, and the crowd roars.) Lead Singer (shouting): “Yo, JayRome’s ridin’ into town, zebra pants flashin’, hair like a crown! You ready to rock with the king of the track? LET’S GO!”\n[Verse 1] He’s got curly blonde locks, flowin’ wild in the breeze, Zebra pants so loud, they bring the cops to their knees! On his bike, he’s a blur, cuttin’ through the dirt, ATV screaming loud, makin’ haters eat his shirt! Blend and YieldBlox, he’s stackin’ that crypto gold, Stellar’s his empire, watch his legend unfold!\n[Pre-Chorus] He’s a rebel, a racer, a blockchain beast, Pedal to the metal, he’s a feast for the streets! No rules, no chains, he’s breakin’ the mold, JayRome’s the name, his story’s untold!\n[Chorus] I AM JAYROME! King of the ride! Zebra stripes flashin’, he’s got nothin’ to hide! I AM JAYROME! Rulin’ the track! Curly hair rockin’, ain’t no turnin’ back! (OH YEAH!) I AM JAYROME!\n[Verse 2] He’s wheelie-poppin’ high, defyin’ gravity’s call, Motocross mayhem, he’s the baddest of all! Crowd’s goin’ wild, they’re chantin’ his name, JayRome’s on fire, settin’ records aflame! Crypto in his veins, Stellar’s his domain, YieldBlox profits, he’s changin’ the game!\n[Pre-Chorus] He’s a rebel, a racer, a blockchain beast, Pedal to the metal, he’s a feast for the streets! No rules, no chains, he’s breakin’ the mold, JayRome’s the name, his story’s untold!\n[Chorus] I AM JAYROME! King of the ride! Zebra stripes flashin’, he’s got nothin’ to hide! I AM JAYROME! Rulin’ the track! Curly hair rockin’, ain’t no turnin’ back! (OH YEAH!) I AM JAYROME!\n[Bridge] (Guitar slows to a gritty, bluesy wail. The singer snarls with attitude.) They try to slow him down, but he’s too fast to tame, JayRome’s a hurricane, burnin’ bright like a flame! Zebra pants dancin’ under stadium lights, He’s the crypto cowboy ridin’ into the night!\n[Guitar Solo] (A face-melting, Mötley Crüe-style solo erupts—think Tommy Lee’s drum rolls and Nikki Sixx’s raw energy. The guitarist is practically setting the stage on fire with whammy bar dives and lightning-fast shredding. The crowd loses it.)\n[Final Chorus] I AM JAYROME! King of the ride! Zebra stripes flashin’, he’s got nothin’ to hide! I AM JAYROME! Rulin’ the track! Curly hair rockin’, ain’t no turnin’ back! I AM JAYROME! Blockchain’s his throne! Stellar’s his kingdom, he’s bad to the bone! (OH YEAH!) I AM JAYROME!\n[Outro] (The band chants “JAY-ROME! JAY-ROME!” as the guitars wail and the ATV engine revs again. The singer screams one last time.) “Bow to the king, ‘cause JayRome’s here to stay! ROCK ON!” (The song ends with a massive cymbal crash and a final guitar squeal.)\nMusical Elements:\n\t•\tGuitars: Dual lead guitars with crunchy power chords and squealing pinch harmonics, like Vince Neil’s anthems or Dee Snider’s in-your-face riffs.\n\t•\tDrums: Pounding double bass drums and Tommy Lee-style fills that drive the song’s relentless energy.\n\t•\tBass: A thumping, groovy bassline that locks in with the drums, giving it that Mötley Crüe swagger.\n\t•\tVocals: A gritty, soaring lead vocal with gang-shouted backing vocals in the chorus, perfect for a stadium sing-along.\n\t•\tProduction: Big, reverb-heavy production with a touch of 80s cheese—think hairspray, pyrotechnics, and a stage full of leather and studs.\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tThe band should wear outrageous outfits—leather jackets, bandanas, and maybe even zebra-print accessories to honor JayRome’s style.\n\t•\tThe music video would feature JayRome tearing up a motocross track, doing insane bike tricks, and flashing his curly blonde hair in slow motion. Cutaways show him trading crypto on a futuristic Stellar interface, with zebra pants stealing the show.\n\t•\tThe chorus is designed for fans to scream along, fists in the air, while the bridge builds to a climactic moment where JayRome himself could make a cameo, revving an ATV onstage.\n\nThis prompt captures the wild, rebellious spirit of hair metal while making JayRome the ultimate rockstar hero. It’s got the hooks, the attitude, and the larger-than-life energy to be a glam metal classic. If you want, I can tweak the lyrics, add more specific details about JayRome, or even generate a visual of him in his zebra pants and torn black shirt for the album cover \n",

Warrior of light!) Smart contract, uchū wo kakeru! (Smart contracts, soaring through the cosmos!) Cosmic chain, eien no yume! (Cosmic chain, an eternal dream!) Stellar Horizon, kagayaku STAR! (Stellar Horizon, blazing STAR!)\n[Outro] (Fading synths, distant choir, and a single guitar riff) Hoshi no umi de, XLM wa kagayaku… (In the sea of stars, Stellar shines…) Smart contract, mirai no hikari… (Smart contracts, the light of the future…)\n\nPerformance Notes:\n\t•\tVocals: A powerful lead singer (think Tetsuya Takahashi or Yoko Kanno’s vocalists) with a mix of raw energy and ethereal grace. Backup choir for the chorus to add a celestial, epic feel.\n\t•\tInstrumentation: Heavy synths for a futuristic vibe, shredding electric guitars for action, and orchestral strings/brass for drama. Fast-paced drums with syncopated rhythms to keep the adrenaline pumping.\n\t•\tVisuals (for the anime intro): Imagine a cosmic battlefield where glowing XLM tokens pulse like stars, warriors wielding smart contract “blades” made of code, and a decentralized network visualized as a radiant web connecting planets. A hero (symbolizing Stellar) rides a comet, clashing with shadowy centralized forces, as Soroban’s light erupts in a climactic explosion.\nCultural Notes:\n\t•\tThe use of “Hikari” (light) and “Hoshi” (star) ties into Stellar’s name and cosmic branding.\n\t•\t“Soroban” refers to Stellar’s smart contract platform, integrated for a nod to tech fans.\n\t•\tThe Japanese lyrics evoke the poetic, grandiose style of anime songs, while English punches through for global appeal and to highlight Stellar’s key features (XLM, smart contracts, cosmic chain).\nThis prompt is designed to be adaptable for a composer or lyricist to flesh out into a full track, but it’s already structured to scream “epic anime intro” with Stellar’s blockchain prowess at its core.

    "Title": "Airdrop Hero",
    "Prompt": "create a Bollywood-style song inspired by high-energy Punjabi pop (think Daler Mehndi’s vibrant, danceable hits), we’ll design a catchy, dancefloor-ready anthem titled “Airdrop Hero” about a rural Indian Airdrop Farmer named Raj, who rises to riches through cryptocurrency airdrops, staying loyal only to himself and bringing glory to his family. As requested, I’ll avoid including specific lyrics but suggest their content and style, prioritizing English with Hindi/Punjabi for flavor to ensure broad appeal. I’ll provide a detailed description of the Bollywood music style (Punjabi pop/Bhangra) and outline the song’s structure with musical and dance cues to make it irresistibly danceable. Bollywood Music Style (Punjabi Pop/Bhangra) Bollywood music in this Punjabi pop style blends traditional Punjabi folk and Bhangra with modern pop and electronic influences, creating an exuberant, dance-driven sound. Its key elements include: • Rhythm and Percussion: The dhol, a double-headed drum, anchors the rhythm with syncopated, booming patterns (e.g., “DHA-TIN-NA” or “DHA-DHA-TIN”), driving a relentless groove. Supporting percussion like tabla, dholak, or electronic claps/snaps adds depth. The tempo is fast, 120–140 BPM, ideal for high-energy Bhangra dance. Rhythmic breaks and fills cue choreography shifts, keeping dancers engaged. • Melody and Vocals: Melodies are simple, repetitive, and rooted in pentatonic or folk scales, crafted for instant sing-alongs. Vocals are bold, theatrical, often nasal for presence, with high-energy delivery. Group chants or call-and-response phrases (e.g., “Oi oi!” or “Hoye hoye!”) foster a communal vibe, encouraging audience participation. • Instrumentation: The tumbi, a single-stringed, twangy instrument, delivers catchy, hypnotic riffs. Shehnai (reedy oboe) or algoza (double flute) add folk flourishes, while synths, electric bass, and guitars bring pop polish. Electronic effects (e.g., reverb, vocal chops) enhance the cinematic scale, balancing rustic roots with modern flair. • Structure: Songs follow a pop format: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro, with a chantable chorus repeated for impact. Instrumental breaks spotlight dhol or tumbi solos, giving dancers a moment to shine. Arrangements build dynamically, layering instruments for a climactic peak. • Danceability: The rhythm fuels Bhangra and Bollywood choreography, with syncopated beats inspiring shoulder shrugs, hand twirls, and group formations. Clear rhythmic cues (e.g., dhol hits, claps) guide dancers, while the infectious energy ensures constant movement. • Mood and Themes: The style is triumphant, communal, and uplifting, often celebrating underdog success or ambition. Lyrics mix humor, pride, and aspiration, blending Hindi, Punjabi, and English for global resonance. The vibe is cinematic, evoking vibrant visuals of village festivals or urban parties. • Production: Tracks are polished, with crisp percussion, deep bass, and lush vocals. Reverb and delay create a stadium-like atmosphere, while dynamic shifts (e.g., sparse verses to explosive choruses) maintain excitement. This style’s infectious energy makes it perfect for Raj’s airdrop-farming journey. Song Concept: “Airdrop Hero” “Airdrop Hero” follows Raj, a rural Indian farmer who discovers crypto airdrops—free tokens from blockchain projects—and turns them into wealth. The song celebrates his hustle, independence from any single project, and the pride he brings to his family. Lyrics (suggested, not written) will prioritize English for accessibility, with Hindi/Punjabi phrases for authenticity, and focus on a catchy, chantable vibe that’s fun and aspirational. The track is a dance anthem, designed for Bhangra-inspired choreography with a singable chorus and rhythmic breaks. Song Structure and Lyric Suggestions • Intro ◦ Musical Cues: Opens with a twangy tumbi riff (e.g., D-E-F#-D) and dhol hits (DHA-TIN-NA) to set a lively mood.

Paint Raj as a savvy player. ◦ Purpose: Shows Raj’s skill and ambition, advancing the narrative. • Pre-Chorus ◦ Musical Cues: Repeats earlier pre-chorus with louder percussion and thicker synths for momentum. ◦ Vocal Style: Same as before, with more intensity in the call-and-response. ◦ Lyric Suggestions: Reiterate Raj’s freedom and rising star, reinforcing self-loyalty.

Maintain English focus with Hindi/Punjabi for rhythm. ◦ Purpose: Reinforces the anthem’s core, amplifying dance energy. • Bridge ◦ Musical Cues: Rhythmic breakdown with dhol (DHA-DHA-TIN-NA) and tumbi solo. Synths drop out briefly, then swell back. Crowd chants drive the energy. ◦ Vocal Style: Call-and-response between lead and crowd, with short, shouted phrases. ◦ Lyric Suggestions: Create a hype moment with questions like “What’s the dream?” answered by “Crypto gleam!” Highlight Raj’s world-shaking rise.

End with a call to dance. ◦ Purpose: A dance-centric break that pumps up the crowd. • Final Chorus ◦ Musical Cues: Full instrumentation, with strings and extra percussion for grandeur. Dhol and synths hit hardest. ◦ Vocal Style: Massive, with layered lead and crowd vocals. Ad-libs add flair. ◦ Lyric Suggestions: Repeat the “Airdrop Hero” hook with maximum energy, emphasizing Raj’s victory and family pride. Use English for “top of the world” and Hindi like “jashn” for celebration. ◦ Purpose: The climactic payoff, leaving listeners buzzing. • Outro ◦ Musical Cues: Tumbi riff and dhol fade, with claps and cheers lingering. Synths soften. ◦ Vocal Style: Vocal ad-libs, playful and triumphant. ◦ Lyric Suggestions: Recap Raj’s crypto rise as a new dawn, using English like “story’s begun” and Hindi like “suraj” (sun). Keep it short and celebratory. ◦ Purpose: Closes with a feel-good fade-out. Musical and Dance Notes • Key and Tempo: D major for a vibrant feel, 132 BPM for dance energy. Dhol follows a Bhangra rhythm (DHA-TIN-NA, DHA-DHA-TIN). • Instrumentation: ◦ Tumbi: Catchy riff in intro and verses, twangy and hypnotic. ◦ Dhol: Drives chorus and bridge with booming hits. ◦ Synthesizer: Basslines and stabs (D-A-Bm-G progression) for pop punch. ◦ Shehnai: Melodic runs in Verse 2 and Chorus for folk flavor. ◦ Claps: Layered in chorus and bridge for crowd vibe. ◦ Strings: Swell in final chorus for cinematic scale. • Production: Polished and loud, with reverb on vocals for a stadium feel. Dynamic shifts (sparse verses, explosive choruses) maintain excitement. • Dance Choreography: Picture a Bollywood video with Raj leading a village dance crew. Moves include: ◦ Bhangra hops: Shoulder shrugs sync with dhol’s “DHA.” ◦ Token grab: Hand gestures mimicking catching coins in the chorus. ◦ Group spins: Circular formations during chants for visual flair. ◦ Hip twists: Playful moves in the bridge’s call-and-response. • Visuals: Vibrant village scenes (fields, colorful attire) mix with futuristic crypto imagery (glowing tokens, digital screens), ending in a massive dance party.

    "Title": "Mundane Daze (Faded Cloud Rap Odyssey)",
    "Prompt": "Song Prompt: “Mundane Daze (Faded Cloud Rap Odyssey)”\nTone and Vibe: Start with a dreamy, melancholic cloud rap sound inspired by Trippie Redd’s early melodic work (think Love Scars) and Drake’s introspective Take Care era—hazy synths, slow 808s, and reverb-heavy vocals. The track gradually morphs into an aggressive, trap-infused banger, leaning into Trippie’s screamed ad-libs and Drake’s cocky Scorpion-era energy. Lyrical content stays hilariously mundane: a random dude narrating his boring day (brushing teeth, grocery shopping, watching TV) with over-the-top bravado, claiming he’s “too turnt up” for every trivial task. Random ad-libs punctuate the story, hyping up the absurdity (e.g., “Skrrt, got that 2 percent!”). The finale—him going to bed—explodes into a chaotic, apocalyptic flex, like he’s ascending to godhood while tucking into his sheets.\n\nStructure and Lyrics Prompt:\nIntro (Melodic, woozy): Over a sparkling synth loop and soft hi-hats, the dude mumbles about waking up, voice drenched in Auto-Tune. Set the scene with a Trippie-style croon: “Yeah, yeah, just another day, but I’m lit, woah…” Toss in a Drake-ish spoken line like, “Man, they don’t know how I move in these suburbs, ayy.”\nVerse 1 (Chill, cloud rap vibe): He’s doing basic morning stuff—brushing his teeth, making instant coffee, checking his phone. Each line starts with “I just [mundane action] and I’m too turnt up.” Keep the delivery smooth, with a laid-back flow. Sprinkle in Trippie-style ad-libs that overhype the situation. Example: “I just brushed my teeth and I’m too turnt up (Skrrt, minty fresh!) Sipped that Folgers drip and I’m too turnt up (Ayy, caffeine, woah!) Scrolled through Insta likes and I’m too turnt up (Yeah, double tap!) Man, this Wi-Fi slow, but I’m still lit up (Hol’ up, bars low!)”\nChorus (Catchy, melodic): A sing-song hook with a Drake-like cadence, boasting about living “that life” despite the banality. Repeat “too turnt” for crowd participation. End with a drawn-out ad-lib like “Yeaaah, mundane, let’s go!” Example: “Too turnt, livin’ that life, yeah, I’m gone (Woah!) Mundane flex, but I shine, yeah, I’m on (Skrrt!) Every day, yeah, I’m lit, never slow (Ayy!) Too turnt up in my zone (Yeaaah, mundane, let’s go!)”\nVerse 2 (Picking up aggression, trap influence): The beat gets harder—snappier snares, booming 808s. He’s now at the grocery store and doing errands, but the delivery is more intense, with Trippie’s growly cadence. Mundane tasks like buying milk or gassing up the Honda are treated like epic quests. Ad-libs get louder and weirder. Example: “I just grabbed that milk and I’m too turnt up (Got that 2 percent, yuh!) Scanned my coupons quick and I’m too turnt up (Beep, savings, ayy!) Filled my Honda tank and I’m too turnt up (Skrrt, unleaded, woah!) Cart got wobbly wheels, but I’m still lit up (Gang, push it, yuh!)”\nChorus (Same, but more hyped): Keep the hook but add a screamed Trippie ad-lib at the end like “TURNT! YEAH!” to match the escalating energy.\nVerse 3 (Full-on aggressive banger): The beat is now a chaotic trap monster—distorted 808s, rapid hi-hats, maybe a siren sample. He’s doing painfully dull stuff like vacuuming or watching reruns, but he’s screaming like it’s a mosh pit. The flow is relentless, with short, punchy lines. Ad-libs are unhinged, almost nonsensical. Example: “I just vacuumed crumbs and I’m too turnt up (Suck it up, yuh!) Flipped to Seinfeld reruns, I’m too turnt up (Kramer slide, ayy!) Ate a bag of chips and I’m too turnt up (Crunch, salt, woah!) Dusted my bookshelf, yeah, I’m still lit up (No dust, gang, yuh!)”\nBridge (Brief, cinematic): Slow it down for a moment with a dreamy interlude. He reflects on his day like it’s a heroic saga, Drake-style: “Man, they don’t get it, I’m out here movin’… laundry, groceries, all that.” Toss in a random ad-lib like “Folded socks, woah!” Then, the beat drops harder than ever.\nFinal Verse (Apocalyptic finale): He’s going to bed, but it’s described like a cosmic event. The beat is pure chaos—think Trippie’s 1400/999 energy with distorted screeches and booming bass. He’s “too turnt up” for brushing his teeth again, fluffing his pillow, and setting his alarm. The imagery gets insane: his bed is a “throne of galaxies,” his blanket is “woven from starlight,” and he’s “flexing on nightmares.” Ad-libs are screamed and layered, like a whole squad hyping him up. Example: “I just brushed my teeth and I’m too turnt up (Galactic paste, yuh!) Fluffed my pillow soft and I’m too turnt up (Cloud nine, ayy!) Set my phone alarm and I’m too turnt up (6 a.m., gang!) Bed’s a starship, yeah, I’m ascendin’ up (Skrrt, to the cosmos, YUHHH!)”\nFinal Chorus (Explosive, double-time): Repeat the chorus twice, but it’s screamed over a beat that sounds like the world’s ending—think meteors crashing. Add a final ad-lib like “SLEEP MODE, GANG, TURNT!” The crowd should feel like they just survived a riot.\nOutro (Fading, surreal): The beat dissolves into ambient synths. He mumbles, half-asleep, “Yeah… too turnt… zzz…” with a final ad-lib: “Snore game, woah.” A faint 808 thump closes it out.\n\nProduction Notes:\n\t•\tStart with a BPM around 70 for the cloudy vibe, then ramp to 85 by Verse 3 for the aggressive trap feel.\n\t•\tLayer Trippie-style ad-libs (high-pitched “yuh!” and “woah!”) and Drake-esque spoken asides (“Ayy, hold up”). Use distortion on the screams in the final verse.\n\t•\tSound palette: sparkly keys and soft pads early, then introduce heavy 808 slides, trap snares, and glitchy vocal chops. The finale should have a “world-ending” effect like reversed cymbals or a choir sample.\n\t•\tFor 2025 flavor, sneak in subtle Gen Z references (e.g., “Scrolled through Reels” or “AirPods maxed”).\n\t•\tKeep the melody simple—think C minor pentatonic for that moody, accessible vibe.\nThis prompt delivers a faded cloud rap track that starts chill, gets aggressively unhinged, but stays hilariously grounded in mundane life, with ad-libs stealing the show.

    "Title": "The American Way",
    "Prompt": "Intro (Spoken, gravelly, over a twangy guitar riff):\n“Well, lemme tell y’all a story ‘bout a man, his truck, and his freedom… and maybe a bald eagle or two. Crank it up, boys!”\nVerse 1 (Grounded, but proud):\nStart with a classic country setup: a hardworking guy in a small town, maybe a mechanic or farmer, living the simple life. He’s got his Chevy truck, a cold beer, and a flag on his porch. He’s grilling burgers, saluting veterans, and tipping his hat to the preacher. Keep it heartfelt but sprinkle in a touch of absurdity—like his dog’s named “Liberty” and wears a tiny cowboy hat.\nExample: “I’m wrenchin’ on my Chevy with a Bud in my hand, / Got a flag on the porch and a John Deere tan. / My dog Liberty’s barkin’ at the mailman’s sway, / ‘Cause that’s the American way!”\nChorus (Anthemic, sing-along):\nA rowdy, repetitive hook that’s equal parts patriotic and absurd. Mention “freedom,” “stars and stripes,” and throw in one random country meme (like “catfish noodlin’”). End with a drawn-out “A-mer-i-can waaaay!” to get the crowd hollering.\nExample: “Raise that beer to the stars and stripes, / Noodlin’ catfish on a Friday night! / From the holler to the highway, we don’t stray, / ‘Cause that’s the American way!”\nVerse 2 (Cranking up the crazy):\nNow it’s getting weird. The guy’s driving his “tractor-truck hybrid” (it’s got monster wheels and a gun rack). He’s wearing blue jeans “forged in the heart of Tennessee” and chugging sweet tea from a mason jar. Toss in 2025 country memes—like he’s TikTok-famous for lassoing a drone or his truck runs on “freedom fuel” (implied to be a mix of whiskey and patriotism). Maybe he arm-wrestles a bear for a bald eagle’s honor.\nExample: “I revved my tractor-truck through a field of dreams, / Blue jeans stitched with liberty seams. / Lassoed a drone for ol’ Glory’s sake, / ‘Cause that’s the American way!”\nChorus (Same as above, but add one more meme):\nKeep the chorus consistent but swap the meme line for something like “Yee-yee hollerin’ in a muddin’ fray.”\nVerse 3 (Unhinged country fever dream):\nGo full absurd. His truck now flies with “eagle wings” and shoots fireworks. He’s roping tornadoes while wearing a cowboy hat made of bacon. His beer is brewed from “mountain dew and freedom tears.” He’s got a pet alligator named “Constitution” riding shotgun, and they’re hauling a trailer full of apple pies to a monster truck rally for veterans. The imagery makes zero sense but feels like a country subreddit exploded.\nExample: “My truck’s got eagle wings, shootin’ sparks in the sky, / Ropin’ tornadoes with a bacon-hat vibe. / Gator named Constitution hauls pies for the fray, / ‘Cause that’s the American way!”\nChorus (Now with maximum chaos):\nAdd a final meme line like “Truck nuts swingin’ in a patriotic play.” Keep the crowd roaring.\nBridge (Spoken, over a slow banjo pluck):\nA moment of fake sincerity where he reflects on “what makes America great.” List off ridiculous things like “Waffle House at 2 a.m.,” “mullets in the wind,” and “Wi-Fi in the deer stand.” End with a patriotic non-sequitur like “And that’s why I saluted the moon last night.”\nFinal Verse (Apocalyptic patriotism):\nThe guy’s now a mythic figure, riding a bald eagle into a sunset made of “red, white, and blue lightning.” His truck is a transformer that turns into a giant flag. He’s grilling a 500-pound burger while leading a parade of monster trucks, ATVs, and lawnmowers. The song ends with him planting a flag on a mountain of empty beer cans while a choir of coyotes howls “Sweet Home Alabama.”\nExample: “I rode that eagle through a star-spangled storm, / Truck turned to a flag, yeah, freedom’s true form. / Planted my colors on a beer-can ridge, / ‘Cause that’s the American way!”\nFinal Chorus (Double-time, explosive):\nRepeat the chorus twice, adding a new meme each time (e.g., “Biscuit-dunkin’ in a gravy parade” and “Shotgun weddin’ with a camouflage veil”). End with a shouted “A-MER-I-CAN WAAAAY!” and a final guitar wail.\nOutro (Spoken, fading out):\n“Y’all, I reckon that’s how we do it… pass me another beer and crank the AC/DC. God bless the USA.”\n\nPerformance Notes:\n•  The band should include a fiddle player who dramatically “saws” during the wild parts and a drummer who hits a cowbell for every meme reference.\n•  Encourage the crowd to chant “Yee-yee!” after each chorus.\n•  For the 2025 vibe, reference modern country TikTok trends (like “truck bed dance challenges” or “camo Crocs”).\n•  Keep the melody simple but punchy—think E major, four-chord progression (E-A-B-E), with a tempo around 120 BPM for that boot-stomping feel.\nThis prompt should yield a song that’s equal parts Toby Keith tribute, patriotic rally, and unhinged country meme explosion—perfect for a 2025 honky-tonk crowd losing their minds. If you want me to flesh out a specific verse or add more 2025-specific memes, let me know!",

    "Title": "ປີໃໝ່ຫົກແຫວກ (Pi Mai Hak Haeg)",
    "Prompt": "Create an extremely exciting and upbeat Mor Lam and Luk Thung fusion song entirely in the Lao language, designed as a 2025 festival anthem for the Pi Mai Lao (Lao New Year) celebration, structured for maximum energy, crowd engagement, and a vivid live performance feel, blending traditional stylistic elements with modern influences tailored for a contemporary Lao audience. The song must be rooted in Mor Lam’s traditional elements (fast, syncopated rhythms, intricate khaen melodies, call-and-response vocals, phin guitar riffs, witty banter) and Luk Thung’s soulful elements (melodic hooks, emotive vocal runs, heartfelt sing-along choruses), but incorporate modern 2025 influences such as subtle electronic enhancements (light synth pulses, modern percussion like trap hi-hats), hip-hop-inspired vocal cadences in Mor Lam sections, and polished production (crisp mixing, enhanced bass). Use a blend of traditional instrumentation (khaen, phin, saw (fiddle), ranat (xylophone), glong drums) and minimal electronic accents to create a fresh, urban-festival sound, avoiding heavy EDM or tropical house. All lyrics, crowd prompts, vocal ad-libs, and spoken elements must be exclusively in Lao, capturing the explosive Pi Mai Lao atmosphere while weaving themes of partying hard, working harder, cherishing rare time off, New Year renewal, and the sensory delight of iconic Lao foods, with references to 2025 youth culture (e.g., social media, festival fashion, urban trends). Set the tempo at an ultra-fast 180 BPM to fuel intense, heart-pounding danceable energy for temple fairs and urban festival stages, evoking a live festival band igniting a roaring, youthful crowd.\nThematic Content:\nThe song celebrates the euphoric release of Pi Mai Lao as a reward for hard work: splashing in water fights with trendy water guns, frenzied dancing at temple fairs or urban festival stages, tying baci strings for blessings, and feasting on Lao delicacies with friends and family while snapping selfies for social media. Emphasize the contrast between grueling workdays (e.g., office jobs, gig economy hustles) and the fleeting, wild freedom of the festival. Include vivid imagery of Pi Mai Lao 2025—water-soaked streets in Vientiane or Luang Prabang lit by LED lanterns, vibrant flower parades with influencers filming, smoky street food stalls with neon signs, and festival-goers in bold, modern attire. Integrate references to Lao foods like sticky rice, tam mak hoong (papaya salad), ping pa (grilled fish), larb, and khao piak sen (noodle soup), tying them to communal revelry and Instagram-worthy moments. Weave in themes of renewal (washing away the old year, starting fresh), gratitude for community, and the hard-earned thrill of rare time off, reflecting the work-hard, party-harder cycle, with nods to 2025 trends like viral dance challenges or festival livestreams. The tone must blend Mor Lam’s cheeky, high-spirited banter with Luk Thung’s heartfelt, uplifting storytelling, driving crowd participation through constant sing-alongs, call-and-response, and live-stage energy, all expressed in vibrant, modern Lao.\nStructural Guidelines:\nTo ensure an extremely exciting, upbeat feel with a live performance vibe, the structure must be fast-paced, with short, punchy sections that maintain relentless energy and maximize audience interaction at 180 BPM, tailored for a 2025 festival crowd:\n•  Mor Lam Influence: Feature rapid, alternating verses with sharp, witty call-and-response exchanges (lead singer vs. chorus or crowd) to hype the audience, incorporating direct crowd prompts in Lao (e.g., urging the crowd to sing, dance, or post online). Use a recurring melodic and lyrical motif (a short, explosive phrase in Lao) after each Mor Lam verse to unify the song and spark sing-alongs, with hip-hop-inspired cadences for a modern edge. Include a high-energy chanted or spoken section in Lao, inspired by Mor Lam’s verbal sparring but styled like a 2025 rap freestyle, to spike excitement and feel like a live MC rallying the crowd.\n•  Luk Thung Influence: Include a short, soaring chorus with a catchy, emotional hook in Lao that invites mass sing-alongs, reflecting Luk Thung’s accessibility, with vocal ad-libs in Lao (e.g., spontaneous shouts or trendy slang) to evoke a live vocalist’s passion. Keep verses concise with vivid, narrative-driven lyrics in Lao that shift from modern work struggles (e.g., late-night shifts, digital hustle) to festival ecstasy, delivered with passionate vocal runs and a pop-inflected melody.\n•  Combined Structure: The song must be 3-4 minutes long, with a streamlined, high-octane structure: intro (brief, punchy), verse 1 (Mor Lam-style, call-and-response with crowd prompt in Lao), recurring motif (in Lao), verse 2 (Luk Thung-style, narrative in Lao), chorus (Luk Thung-style hook with ad-libs in Lao), verse 3 (Mor Lam-style, banter with crowd prompt in Lao), recurring motif (in Lao), verse 4 (Luk Thung-style, emotional surge in Lao), chorus (in Lao), bridge (short, intense, blending styles, in Lao), double chorus with motif reprise (in Lao), outro (explosive, in Lao). Each section must transition quickly to sustain relentless momentum and feel like a live 2025 festival set.\n•  Tempo and Mood: Set the tempo at 180 BPM for a frenetic, heart-pounding pace, with Mor Lam’s rapid rhythms, Luk Thung’s soaring melodies, and subtle electronic accents creating an electrifying, communal vibe that demands dancing, shouting, and crowd participation.\nMusical Arrangement Notes:\n•  Intro: Launch with a rapid khaen melody and phin guitar riff, backed by glong drums and ching cymbals for a high-octane Mor Lam groove, layered with a Luk Thung-style saw (fiddle) and a subtle synth pulse for 2025 flair. Include ambient Pi Mai Lao sounds (water splashes, temple bells, grilling sizzles) and crowd cheers, plus a modern festival touch like a faint digital beat drop. Start with a vocal shout in Lao (e.g., a Pi Mai Lao rallying cry or social media hashtag) to mimic a band leader hyping a 2025 crowd.\n•  Verses: Alternate Mor Lam verses with khaen-led call-and-response, phin flourishes, and trap-inspired hi-hats, featuring crowd prompts in Lao and playful khaen-phin duets, and Luk Thung verses with saw or ranat-backed melodic storytelling, boosted by light bass and vocal ad-libs in Lao for live energy. Use layered vocals and crowd responses to simulate a festival audience.\n•  Recurring Motif: A short, explosive khaen-and-vocal phrase in Lao (e.g., hyping Pi Mai Lao or tam mak hoong) that recurs after Mor Lam verses, designed for the crowd to shout back, with a modern vocal cadence to amplify the live feel.\n•  Chorus: A Luk Thung-style sing-along hook in Lao with soaring vocals, khaen, phin, and ranat, backed by glong drums and a subtle electronic bassline, emphasizing festival joy and renewal, delivered at breakneck speed with ad-libs in Lao.\n•  Bridge: Briefly slow to a relative 120 BPM with a reflective khaen or saw solo, soft vocals in Lao, and a minimal synth hum, focusing on hard work, fleeting joy, and Lao food’s comfort, before surging back to 180 BPM for a high-energy double chorus with a modern vocal flourish.\n•  Outro: Reprise the recurring motif in Lao with full instrumentation, fading crowd cheers, a final vocal shout in Lao, and a subtle digital fade-out, evoking a 2025 festival peaking in chaos and joy.\nLyrical Guidelines:\nAll lyrics, crowd prompts, ad-libs, and spoken elements must be entirely in Lao, using natural, conversational language with 2025-relevant regional slang, poetic flourishes, or Isan-influenced dialect for authenticity and youth appeal. Balance Mor Lam’s witty, playful banter (e.g., teasing about modern work or festival trends like viral videos) with Luk Thung’s heartfelt storytelling (e.g., longing for time off, cherishing community). Keep lyrics accessible, energetic, and singable, avoiding overly formal phrasing. Include a rhythmic spoken or chanted section in Lao, styled like a Mor Lam rap with 2025 slang, tying to Pi Mai Lao or food imagery, and referencing modern Lao youth culture (e.g., festival livestreams, dance challenges).\nExample Lyrical Themes (described, not quoted):\n•  Lyrics about grinding in modern jobs but now rocking Pi Mai Lao with sticky rice and selfies.\n•  Playful banter about tam mak hoong’s spice and water fights with trendy festival gear.\n•  Heartfelt lines about tying baci strings and savoring grilled fish, embracing the new year online and offline.\n•  Energetic verses about hard work fading as larb and laughter go viral at the festival.\nDeliver the full song with all lyrics, crowd prompts, and ad-libs in Lao, a detailed description of the musical arrangement, and a brief explanation of how it captures the Mor Lam and Luk Thung traditions, embodies the Pi Mai Lao spirit, and resonates with a modern 2025 Lao audience by celebrating hard work, hard partying, precious time off, and the sensory joy of Lao cuisine during the New Year festival, with a live performance energy that feels like a futuristic festival stage in full swing.",

    "Prompt": "Create an extremely exciting and upbeat Mor Lam and Luk Thung fusion song entirely in the Lao language, designed as a 2025 festival anthem for the Pi Mai Lao (Lao New Year) celebration, structured for maximum energy, crowd engagement, and a vivid live performance feel, adhering strictly to the traditional stylistic elements of both genres. The song must be deeply rooted in Mor Lam’s traditional elements (fast, syncopated rhythms, intricate khaen melodies, call-and-response vocals, phin guitar riffs, witty banter) and Luk Thung’s soulful elements (melodic hooks, emotive vocal runs, heartfelt sing-along choruses), with minimal modern influences limited to subtle production polish (e.g., clean mixing, slight bass enhancement) to preserve authenticity. Use traditional instrumentation like khaen, phin, saw (fiddle), ranat (xylophone), and glong drums, avoiding EDM, tropical house, or synth-driven sounds. All lyrics, crowd prompts, vocal ad-libs, and spoken elements must be exclusively in Lao, capturing the explosive Pi Mai Lao atmosphere while weaving themes of partying hard, working harder, cherishing rare time off, New Year renewal, and the sensory delight of iconic Lao foods. Set the tempo at an ultra-fast 180 BPM to fuel intense, heart-pounding danceable energy for temple fairs and village stages, evoking a live festival band igniting a roaring crowd.\nThematic Content:\nThe song celebrates the euphoric release of Pi Mai Lao as a reward for hard work: splashing in water fights, frenzied dancing at temple fairs or village stages, tying baci strings for blessings, and feasting on Lao delicacies with friends and family. Emphasize the contrast between grueling workdays and the fleeting, wild freedom of the festival. Include vivid imagery of Pi Mai Lao—water-soaked streets in Vientiane or Luang Prabang, vibrant flower parades, smoky street food stalls, and lanterns blazing at night. Integrate references to Lao foods like sticky rice, tam mak hoong (papaya salad), ping pa (grilled fish), larb, and khao piak sen (noodle soup), tying them to communal revelry. Weave in themes of renewal (washing away the old year, starting fresh), gratitude for community, and the hard-earned thrill of rare time off, reflecting the work-hard, party-harder cycle. The tone must blend Mor Lam’s cheeky, high-spirited banter with Luk Thung’s heartfelt, uplifting storytelling, driving crowd participation through constant sing-alongs, call-and-response, and live-stage energy, all expressed in natural Lao.\nStructural Guidelines:\nTo ensure an extremely exciting, upbeat feel with a live performance vibe, the structure must be fast-paced, with short, punchy sections that maintain relentless energy and maximize audience interaction at 180 BPM:\n•  Mor Lam Influence: Feature rapid, alternating verses with sharp, witty call-and-response exchanges (lead singer vs. chorus or crowd) to hype the audience, incorporating direct crowd prompts in Lao (e.g., urging the crowd to sing or dance). Use a recurring melodic and lyrical motif (a short, explosive phrase in Lao) after each Mor Lam verse to unify the song and spark sing-alongs, mimicking Mor Lam’s improvisational intensity. Include a high-energy chanted or spoken section in Lao, inspired by Mor Lam’s verbal sparring, to spike excitement and feel like a live MC rallying the crowd.\n•  Luk Thung Influence: Include a short, soaring chorus with a catchy, emotional hook in Lao that invites mass sing-alongs, reflecting Luk Thung’s accessibility, with vocal ad-libs in Lao (e.g., spontaneous shouts or flourishes) to evoke a live vocalist’s passion. Keep verses concise with vivid, narrative-driven lyrics in Lao that shift from work’s grind to festival ecstasy, delivered with passionate vocal runs.\n•  Combined Structure: The song must be 3-4 minutes long, with a streamlined, high-octane structure: intro (brief, punchy), verse 1 (Mor Lam-style, call-and-response with crowd prompt in Lao), recurring motif (in Lao), verse 2 (Luk Thung-style, narrative in Lao), chorus (Luk Thung-style hook with ad-libs in Lao), verse 3 (Mor Lam-style, banter with crowd prompt in Lao), recurring motif (in Lao), verse 4 (Luk Thung-style, emotional surge in Lao), chorus (in Lao), bridge (short, intense, blending styles, in Lao), double chorus with motif reprise (in Lao), outro (explosive, in Lao). Each section must transition quickly to sustain relentless momentum and feel like a live set.\n•  Tempo and Mood: Set the tempo at 180 BPM for a frenetic, heart-pounding pace, with Mor Lam’s rapid rhythms and Luk Thung’s soaring melodies creating an electrifying, communal vibe that demands dancing, shouting, and crowd participation.\nMusical Arrangement Notes:\n•  Intro: Launch with a rapid, fiery khaen melody and phin guitar riff, backed by glong drums and ching cymbals to ignite a high-octane Mor Lam groove, with a Luk Thung-style saw (fiddle) adding warmth. Include ambient Pi Mai Lao sounds (water splashes, temple bells, grilling sizzles) and crowd cheers to set a live festival stage atmosphere. Start with a brief vocal shout in Lao (e.g., a festival greeting or Pi Mai Lao rallying cry) to mimic a band leader hyping the crowd.\n•  Verses: Alternate Mor Lam verses with khaen-led call-and-response and phin flourishes, featuring crowd prompts in Lao and playful instrumental interplay (e.g., khaen-phin duets), and Luk Thung verses with saw or ranat-backed melodic storytelling, with vocal ad-libs in Lao for live energy. Use layered vocals and crowd responses to simulate audience participation.\n•  Recurring Motif: A short, explosive khaen-and-vocal phrase in Lao (e.g., celebrating Pi Mai Lao or tam mak hoong) that recurs after Mor Lam verses, designed for the crowd to shout back, amplifying the live feel.\n•  Chorus: A Luk Thung-style sing-along hook in Lao with soaring vocals, khaen, and phin, backed by ranat and drums, emphasizing festival joy and renewal, delivered at breakneck speed with ad-libs in Lao.\n•  Bridge: Briefly slow to a relative 120 BPM with a reflective khaen or saw solo and soft vocals in Lao, focusing on hard work, fleeting joy, and Lao food’s comfort, before surging back to 180 BPM for a high-energy double chorus.\n•  Outro: Reprise the recurring motif in Lao with full instrumentation, fading crowd cheers, and a final vocal shout in Lao, evoking a festival peaking in chaos and joy.\nLyrical Guidelines:\nAll lyrics, crowd prompts, ad-libs, and spoken elements must be entirely in Lao, using natural, conversational language with regional slang, poetic flourishes, or Isan-influenced dialect for authenticity. Balance Mor Lam’s witty, playful banter (e.g., teasing about work or festival antics) with Luk Thung’s heartfelt storytelling (e.g., longing for time off, cherishing community). Keep lyrics accessible, energetic, and singable, avoiding overly formal phrasing. Include a rhythmic spoken or chanted section in Lao, inspired by Mor Lam’s verbal sparring, tying to Pi Mai Lao or food imagery, with a nod to modern Lao youth culture for relatability.\nExample Lyrical Themes (described, not quoted):\n•  Lyrics about working tirelessly but now reveling in Pi Mai Lao with sticky rice feasts.\n•  Playful banter about tam mak hoong’s spice and water fights under festival lights.\n•  Heartfelt lines about tying baci strings and savoring grilled fish, embracing the new year.\n•  Energetic verses about hard work fading as larb and laughter fill the night.\nDeliver the full song with all lyrics, crowd prompts, and ad-libs in Lao, a detailed description of the musical arrangement, and a brief explanation of how it captures the Mor Lam and Luk Thung traditions, embodies the Pi Mai Lao spirit, and resonates with a modern Lao audience by celebrating hard work, hard partying, precious time off, and the sensory joy of Lao cuisine during the New Year festival, with a live performance energy that feels like a festival stage in full swing.",

    "Prompt": "Create a high-energy, danceable Mor Lam and Luk Thung fusion song in the Lao language, designed to be a 2025 festival anthem for the Pi Mai Lao (Lao New Year) celebration. The song should blend traditional Mor Lam elements (fast-paced rhythms, khaen melodies, call-and-response vocals, phin guitar) with Luk Thung’s soulful storytelling, melodic hooks, and emotive vocal delivery, while integrating modern influences like EDM drops, tropical house beats, and polished pop production (vibrant synths, deep bass, festival-ready sound). The lyrics should be joyful, communal, and uplifting, capturing the electrifying vibe of Pi Mai Lao while emphasizing partying hard, working harder, cherishing rare time off, New Year renewal, and the sensory delight of iconic Lao foods.\nThe theme centers on living it up during Pi Mai Lao as a reward for hard work: splashing in water fights, dancing at temple fairs or village stages, tying baci strings for blessings, and feasting on Lao delicacies with friends and family. Highlight the contrast between grinding through long workdays and unleashing wild energy during the festival’s fleeting freedom. Include vivid imagery of Lao New Year scenes—water-soaked streets in Vientiane or Luang Prabang, flower-decked parades, sizzling street food stalls with smoky grills, and lanterns glowing under starry skies. Integrate references to Lao foods like sticky rice, tam mak hoong (papaya salad), grilled fish (ping pa), larb, and khao piak sen (noodle soup), tying them to the joy of communal feasting and celebration. Weave in themes of renewal (washing away the old year, starting fresh), gratitude for community, and the hard-earned joy of rare time off, with a nod to the cycle of hard work and hard play. The tone should be festive, playful, and slightly cheeky, with Luk Thung’s emotional depth adding nostalgia or heartfelt connection to the fleeting moment. Craft a catchy, repetitive chorus for crowd sing-alongs and a bridge that blends Mor Lam’s rhythmic energy with Luk Thung’s soulful reflection, tying together the work-hard, party-harder ethos, Pi Mai Lao’s cultural significance, and the comfort of Lao cuisine.\nThe song should be 3-4 minutes long, with a structure of intro, verse 1, pre-chorus, chorus, verse 2, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, final chorus, and outro. Lyrics must be in Lao, using natural, conversational language with regional slang, poetic flourishes, or Isan-influenced dialect for authenticity, balancing Mor Lam’s playful banter with Luk Thung’s lyrical storytelling. Keep it accessible, energetic, and singable, avoiding overly formal phrasing. Optionally, include a short rap or rhythmic chant section for a modern twist, reflecting urban Lao youth culture. The melody should be infectious, with a tempo of 120-140 BPM, perfect for dancing at festival stages, street parties, or rural celebrations.\nMusical Arrangement Notes:\n•  Open with a khaen riff and phin strums to anchor the Mor Lam/Luk Thung roots, paired with Luk Thung-style violin or accordion for emotional warmth, then transition into a pulsing EDM beat.\n•  Incorporate water splash sound effects, temple bells, or the sizzle of grilling food in the intro to evoke Pi Mai Lao’s atmosphere.\n•  Build a massive chorus with layered call-and-response vocals, a bass-heavy EDM drop, and Luk Thung-inspired melodic flourishes for sing-along appeal.\n•  In the bridge, slow down with a solo khaen, phin, or Luk Thung-style vocal run to reflect on hard work, fleeting joy, and the comfort of Lao food, before exploding into a high-energy final chorus with Mor Lam’s rhythmic drive.\nDeliver the full song with Lao lyrics, a detailed description of the musical arrangement, and a brief explanation of how it captures the Mor Lam and Luk Thung traditions, embodies the Pi Mai Lao spirit, and resonates with a modern Lao audience by celebrating hard work, hard partying, precious time off, and the sensory joy of Lao cuisine during the New Year festival.",

We flip the block!  \n  \nPre-Chorus:  \nTwo kings, one crown, we take it higher,  \nHeat so fierce, we burn like fire,  \nNever backin' down, we climb the wire,  \nThis world’s ours, we desire!  \n  \nChorus:  \nUnstoppable Queens, we run the game,  \nRise like a storm, we can’t be tamed,  \nFrom the shadows to the neon flame,  \nWe reign supreme, remember our name!  \n  \nVerse 2:  \nBlack and red, we light the way,  \nMultitaskin', we slay all day.  \nRunnin' the show, we never stray,  \nPushin' the limits, no delay.  \n  \nFast like lightning, sharp like steel,  \nChasin' dreams that no one can steal,  \nWe break the mold, we break the seal,  \nStep in our world, you’ll know how we feel.  \n  \nPre-Chorus:  \nTwo kings, one crown, we take it higher,  \nHeat so fierce, we burn like fire,  \nNever backin' down, we climb the wire,  \nThis world’s ours, we desire!  \n  \nChorus:  \nUnstoppable Queens, we run the game,  \nRise like a storm, we can’t be tamed,  \nFrom the shadows to the neon flame,  \nWe reign supreme, remember our name!  \n  \nBridge:  \nThey said we couldn’t, now look at us,  \nDominating the field, no need to discuss.  \nAgainst the odds, we rise above,  \nA queen’s grind, we’re built on love.  \n  \nChorus:  \nUnstoppable Queens, we run the game,  \nRise like a storm, we can’t be tamed,  \nFrom the shadows to the neon flame,  \nWe reign supreme, remember our name!  \n  \nOutro:  \nWe’re the future, we’re the crown,  \nBlazing trails, we own this town.  \nUnstoppable Queens, wear it proud,  \nNever backin' down, we say it loud!",
