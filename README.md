# Smol - AI Music & ZK Gaming Lab ⚡

**Production**: [noot.smol.xyz](https://noot.smol.xyz) | **Hackathon Preview**: [smol-fe-7jl.pages.dev](https://smol-fe-7jl.pages.dev) | **Docs**: [Information Architecture](docs/INDEX.md)

Smol is a decentralized high-fidelity application powered by **Stellar Smart Contracts** and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)**. It combines generative AI music with on-chain verifiable gaming mechanics.

## 🎵 Smol Music: The Core Product
Smol is the premier destination for high-fidelity, AI-generated music on the Stellar network. Developed as an **officially maintained** high-fidelity fork of **[smol.xyz](https://smol.xyz)**, this repository retains all original ecosystem connections while introducing advanced organization, enhanced performance, and new experimental features.

-   🏆 **Kalepail-Approved Builds**: Stable, production-ready releases are deployed to **[noot.smol.xyz](https://noot.smol.xyz)**.
-   🧪 **Experimental Alpha**: The latest cutting-edge updates and "Everything Lab" features are first deployed to the **[Pages Dev Preview](https://smol-fe-7jl.pages.dev)**.
- **Generative AI Audio**: Produce high-fidelity, diverse musical variations at the click of a button.
- **On-Chain Minting**: Seamlessly transform generations into NFTs via our integrated Soroban smart contracts.
- **Social Tipping & Splits**: Support your favorite artists with direct tips in **XLM**, **KALE**, or **USDC**. Our contract-level splits ensure fair distribution between artists, curators, and minters.
- **Mixtape Builder**: Create and publish on-chain mixtapes to share your curated collections with the community.
- **Radio V2**: Experience a 24/7 stream of the latest and greatest community-minted songs.
- **Passkey Security**: Zero seed phrases. Authenticate and sign transactions securely using device biometrics via **PasskeyKit**.

## 🛡️ The Future: PasskeyKit & Smart Accounts
Smol is built on the belief that Web3 must be invisible to reach the next billion users. We achieve this through a state-of-the-art **Smart Account** architecture.
- **PasskeyKit Smart Wallets**: By leveraging WebAuthn, we've replaced confusing seed phrases with the biometrics users already trust (FaceID, TouchID). Your device *is* your key.
- **Onboarding Billions**: Our architecture removes the "Gas Gap". Users can join and start creating **for free** without ever needing to buy XLM or understand transaction fees.
- **No Trustline Hurdles**: Unlike traditional Stellar accounts, these Smart Wallets can receive any amount of any coin instantly **for free**. No manual trustline setup required for incoming payments—anybody can send assets to a Smol wallet and it just works.
- **Seamless Sending**: When enabled, these smart accounts can send any asset out **for free** (via sponsored fee channels) as easily as they receive them, maintaining full compatibility with the broader Stellar ecosystem.
- **Kale Relayer & OpenZeppelin**: We utilize the **Kale Relayer** in tandem with **OpenZeppelin GSN (Gas Station Network)** patterns to sponsor transaction fees. This allows the base product to feel like a high-speed "Web2" app while maintaining "Web3" sovereignty.
- **Programmable Accounts**: Every account is a smart contract, enabling complex features like multi-sig, recovery, and batching that standard accounts cannot touch.

## 🧪 Smol Labs: The Everything Lab
While **Smol** serves as our base product and AI music foundation, **Labs** is our "Everything Lab"—a high-fidelity R&D environment where we showcase the newest and greatest innovations on the **Stellar Network**. It is an active testing ground for:
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK)**: On-chain verifiable gaming and privacy-preserving state settlement.
- **AI Music Automation**: Advanced generative audio pipelines and NFT minting experiments.
- **Stellar Innovations**: Soroban session keys, batch transitions, and next-gen smart contract patterns.
- **Personal Tools**: Custom developer utilities and experimental interfaces designed for anyone to play with and extend.

We use Labs to push the boundaries of what is possible on Stellar, transforming half-baked ideas into verifiable, state-of-the-art decentralized experiences.

## 🕹️ ZK Dungeon (Hackathon Mode)
A flagship experiment within the Labs section, participating in the **DoraHacks Stellar Hacks: ZK Gaming** hackathon.
- **Verifiable Strategy**: Uses **Noir**, **RISC0**, and **Circom** to generate zero-knowledge proofs of gameplay, verified on-chain via Stellar.
- **Multiplayer State Channels**: Proxied relay architecture for seamless peer-to-peer gaming.

## 🏗️ Core Technology
- **Framework**: Astro `5.x` + Svelte `5.x` (Runes)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS `4.x` (Design-Tokens first)
- **Blockchain**: Stellar/Soroban (Mainnet via PasskeyKit, Testnet via SWK)
- **Cryptography**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Noir, RISC0, Circom)
- **Architecture**: Server-side Astro Proxy for bypassing CORS during decentralized relay syncing.
